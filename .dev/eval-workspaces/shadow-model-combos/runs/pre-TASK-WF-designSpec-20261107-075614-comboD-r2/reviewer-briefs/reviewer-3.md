# Reviewer brief 3 (refactorer)

You are reviewer 3, persona refactorer: hunt structural problems in the plan: wrong or missing dependencies, a task that narrows or drops spec scope, work placed in the wrong task, ordering hazards, and constraints no task enforces.

Audit the plan (tasklist) against its driving spec before execution. The plan was already executed once; judge what the plan and spec say, not the state of HEAD, and do not report a post-implementation difference as a plan defect. Read-only: no edits, no shell, no git.
Full files, if you need more than the hunks: spec `.dev/eval-workspaces/shadow-model-combos/input/TASK-WF-designSpec-20261107-075614/source.md`, plan `.dev/eval-workspaces/shadow-model-combos/input/TASK-WF-designSpec-20261107-075614/TASK-WF-designSpec-20261107-075614.md` (Read, Grep and Glob are allowed).

## T1 card excerpt

# T1 reflection card (UC-1, pre-execution)

- spec: `.dev/eval-workspaces/shadow-model-combos/input/TASK-WF-designSpec-20261107-075614/source.md` (378 lines, design spec v3, issue #375)
- plan: `.dev/eval-workspaces/shadow-model-combos/input/TASK-WF-designSpec-20261107-075614/TASK-WF-designSpec-20261107-075614.md` (200 lines, 13 tasks, 5 phases)
- attribution note: the plan was already executed (PR #428, commit 0b8a5801d is the only commit that touches `merge_guard.py`). A defect is a plan or spec defect only if it existed at plan time; post-implementation HEAD state is evidence of what execution found, not a plan failure.

#### Coverage (Step 1B.0, deterministic script `artifacts/coverage-map.py`)

- Pass 1 (ID_REGEX `R-/REQ-/SPEC-/T-`): 0 parsed ids in the spec and 0 in the tasklist. The spec labels its requirements FR-n, F-n, G-n, O-n, which the regex does not match.
- Pass 2: 90 inferred rows, each quote-pinned to one spec line (0 dropped). Containment match (>= 0.6 of content words in one task item): 74 matched, 16 unmatched.
- `coverage_pct` null (parsed total 0). `coverage_pct_union` 0.8222. `coverage_degraded: parsed-sparse` (90 inferred > 0 parsed), which forbids a Tier-1 stop.
- `S_dev_density` = (16 + 0) / 90 = 0.1778 (mechanical, union denominator). Below 0.20, so rule 5 alone would not escalate.
- Manual read of the 16 unmatched rows: all 16 have a covering task. INF-004, 010, 013, 023, 034, 044, 045, 046, 052, 075, 081 map to Tasks 3, 4, 7, 11. INF-048, 049 map to Tasks 6 and 12. INF-078, 079, 080 are tasklist constraints with no task of their own. The unmatched count is a limit of word-overlap matching, not a plan gap.
- Method limit: tasks are 150 to 500 words each, so containment of a short quote is easy to satisfy. 16 matches fall between 0.60 and 0.75 and deserve a human look (listed in `artifacts/coverage-matrix.json`, key `thin_matches_lt_0.75`).

### Structural / tech-debt slice (refactorer lens)

- T1-F7 (MINOR): Task 2's grep criterion ("shows no remaining claim that the enum has 43 members", plan:49) is a judgment call, not a mechanical check; `models.py` keeps a legitimate comment "the 42nd-43rd" for the conflict events, so a literal "no `43`" reading fails and a loose reading cannot fail.


End your card with a ## Findings block holding one fenced findings-v2 block: JSON lines, one object per line, never a table. Fields: id (F1, F2, ...), severity (CRITICAL, MAJOR or MINOR), blocking (true or false; a MINOR finding is never blocking), category (one of contradiction, data-loss, missing-requirement, other, safety, unpassable-check), lens "reflect-pre", claim (one line, at most 300 characters), refs (requirement ids, may be empty) and citations (1 to 8 objects, each with role plan or spec, a repo-relative path, line_start, line_end and an optional quote). Example line: {"id":"F1","severity":"MAJOR","blocking":false,"category":"contradiction","lens":"reflect-pre","claim":"Task 3 says X but task 5 says Y.","refs":["R-1"],"citations":[{"role":"plan","path":"plan.md","line_start":10,"line_end":12}]}. After the block add a reviewer_model_self_report line stating the model you are running as in one line. Write the literal heading `## Findings block` and open the fence with ```findings-v2 (not ```json). Keep each claim at or under 300 characters and each quote at or under 200. After the self-report line add `rows_verified:` followed by the assigned row ids you actually checked. Return the whole card as your final message; you are read-only, the orchestrator saves it.

### 4.5 Protocol and docs

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/refs/merge-guard.md` (new) | The procedure of sections 3 and 4.1 to 4.4 as protocol steps (read, decide, request, mutate, settle) for Engage, Pre-push, Release, Exit report and Resume. Loaded lazily at L3 Wave 3, Wave 6 and Wave 8. Uses `scripts/...` and `superclaude.pr_submit.merge_guard` names only. |
| `SKILL.md` | One short bullet under each of Wave 0, Wave 3, Wave 6 and Wave 8, written as new sentences after, never inside, the pinned sentences. The Wave 0 bullet applies at every ordinal and in both modes: on `--resume`, or when the run log holds guard events, it loads the ref (Resume and Exit report) before Wave 1 and before any edit, release or re-trigger; at L3 with `--merge-guard off` it prints the unprotected line once. The Wave 3, Wave 6 and Wave 8 bullets load the ref only at L3 with `draft`: the Wave 3 bullet states that engage happens at the end of Wave 3 only when at least one verified finding of Medium severity or higher is routed to a fix, and once per cycle id (it must not contain the words `evidence-validator` or `conflict-intent.md`, which a line-content test allows only on lines that also say "Tier 2"); the Wave 6 bullet states that Pre-push runs at the pre-push head guard step before `push_decision` and Release runs after `push_completed` before reply, resolve and the re-trigger; the Wave 8 bullet states that a CI-fix cycle engages with kind `ci` and releases after `push_completed` before the CI re-poll. Also one `--merge-guard {draft,off}` row in the Required Input flag table beside `--conflict-max-tier`; one row `merge_guard` in the output table, which also carries the literal L2 line "PR #N is still mergeable; this run's fixes are local only." so that a fresh L2 run prints it without loading the ref; one line in the wave structure list. The Wave 0 bullet is a flat line placed before the Wave 1 bullet and contains no L3 or `draft` condition (the Wave bullets are flat lines, not headings, so the test checks position and wording). No new python fence (the one-fence tests, `test_cosmos_protocol.py:34-44`, `test_codex_reviews.py:685-697`). |
| `refs/loop-guard.md` | Its event-type enumeration says the enum has 43 members; update it to 45 and name `draft_guard_requested` and `draft_guard_settled`, without the words `gh` or `git` (the file is in `CORE_PURE_FILES`). |
| `refs/state-machine.md` | Overlay note: the guard phases are fold values, not `MonitorState` members. Respect the wait-only sentences pinned at `test_static_grep.py:791`. |
| `commands/pr-submit.md` | `--merge-guard {draft,off}` in the argument-hint and the Options table; a short "Merge guard" section next to "Merge-conflict handling". |
| `docs/user-guide/commands.md`, `docs/user-guide/flags.md` | Flag row and a paragraph: what it does, the clear command, `held` meaning, default on. |

Output field `merge_guard`: `off`, `released`, `held`, `user_override`, `unavailable`. A `held` report always carries the reason and `gh pr ready <N> --repo <REPO>` (formatted by the SKILL, never by the core, because the core cannot contain `gh`). At L2 the final report adds: "PR #N is still mergeable; this run's fixes are local only." (the literal line lives in the SKILL.md output table; the ref's Exit report section refers to it and does not carry its own copy).

### 4.6 Cycle identity

`fix_cycle_id` gives guard-enabled cycles an explicit id: `fix-<n>` for review-fix cycles and `ci-<n>` for CI-fix cycles, `n` from `next_cycle_number`. The SKILL mints it at the end of Wave 3 and uses the same id as the `cycle_id` of the push triad (`push_idempotency_key`) and of `rereview_requested`, so the guard, the push and the re-trigger of one cycle share a key. With `--merge-guard off` nothing changes. The build must first confirm where the SKILL assigns a fix cycle's id today and keep exactly one source for it (open item O1).

### 4.7 Pinned write-verb classification (F12)

Every new line under `src/superclaude/skills/`, `src/superclaude/commands/` or `src/superclaude/agents/` that contains `gh pr`, `gh api` or a git write verb is a hit of `WRITE_VERB_RE` and needs one entry in `WRITE_VERB_CLASSIFICATION` in `tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py`: the key is the repo-relative path, the verb text (`gh pr`, `gh api`) and the exact stripped line; the value is category `never-worker` with the standard pr-submit reason text used by the neighbouring entries (the pr-submit monitor is on the never-as-worker list). The entries are added after the text of each file is final, as the last step of the task that writes the file, because a later edit of a classified line makes the entry stale and fails `test_classification_table_has_no_stale_entries`. The new files that carry hits are `scripts/set-draft-state.sh`, `refs/merge-guard.md`, `src/superclaude/commands/pr-submit.md` and any new `SKILL.md` line; a new line that does not need the words `gh pr` (for example "print the clear command from the ref") avoids an entry. The `read-only` category is not used for these calls (a `gh pr ready` mutation is never read-only). `docs/user-guide/` is outside the scanned roots.

| `.../refs/merge-guard.md` | new | section 4.5 |
| `.../SKILL.md`, `.../refs/state-machine.md`, `.../refs/loop-guard.md` | edit | additive only (loop-guard: the 43 to 45 enumeration text) |

| `tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py` | edit | one `WRITE_VERB_CLASSIFICATION` entry per new hit line (section 4.7); added last in each task that writes a file with hits |
| `tests/pr_submit/test_run_log.py`, `test_codex_reviews.py`, `test_static_grep.py`, `test_skill_parse.py` | edit | count 43 to 45 at `test_run_log.py:171-175` and `test_codex_reviews.py:441`; `"draft_guard": None` at `test_run_log.py:312`; `merge_guard.py` into the zero-token file set; script lists only after checking each list's purpose; flag default and choices test mirroring `--conflict-max-tier` |

After editing under `src/superclaude/`: `make sync-dev`, then `make verify-sync`. Run `make sync-dev` at the end of every task that edits a file under `src/superclaude/skills/` or `src/superclaude/commands/`, because `tests/cli/test_verify_sync_hooks.py` runs `make verify-sync` inside the full suite; the final task also runs `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_verify_sync_hooks.py tests/unit/test_cli_install.py -q`. A repo-wide pin (F12) escaped two reviews because only `tests/pr_submit` was run, so the final task runs the FULL suite (`uv run pytest -q tests`) and compares its failures with the base-commit record. Record `make lint`, `uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/` and the full-suite result (`uv run pytest -q tests`: pass count and every failing test id) on the base commit before the first code edit (pre-existing failures are not this feature's). Never stage `.claude/`. Unchanged and must still pass: `test_idempotency.py:89` (7 sets), the one-python-fence tests, `test_conflict_sync_protocol.py:576` (no `src/superclaude` text in skill or command files).

## Phase 3: Protocol text

## Task 8: Write the protocol reference `refs/merge-guard.md`

Depends on: Task 1
Depends on: Task 4
Depends on: Task 7

Create `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/refs/merge-guard.md` from ./source.md sections 3, 4.1, 4.5, 4.6 and 5, as protocol steps (read with `scripts/set-draft-state.sh --read`, decide with `superclaude.pr_submit.merge_guard`, append the `draft_guard_requested` event with fsync before the call, run `scripts/set-draft-state.sh --to`, append `draft_guard_settled`) for: Engage at the end of Wave 3 (L3, only when at least one verified finding of Medium severity or higher is routed to a fix, once per cycle id; review-fix cycles and CI-fix cycles; mints the cycle id with `fix_cycle_id` in the single place named by Task 1 O1 and reuses it as the `cycle_id` of the push triad and of `rereview_requested`; prints the clear command `gh pr ready <N> --repo "$REPO"` once); Pre-push (the script `--read` must show `OPEN` at the pre-push head guard step before `push_decision`, otherwise halt `pr_not_open`, push nothing, report the local commit); Release (after `push_completed`, head equals `target_sha`, or zero-edit proof with this cycle's applied-edit count, before reply, resolve and the S5a re-trigger; one retry; `already in target state` counts as confirmed); Foreign toggle and unreadable timeline handling; Exit report (the `merge_guard` field mapping of `guard_status`, the held-exit list with the clear command, and for the L2 line a pointer to the SKILL.md output table, which carries the literal text; the ref holds no second copy of it); Resume, loaded from Wave 0 at every ordinal and in both modes (`resume_decision` rows, the three `RECONCILE` reasons, the `landed`, `not_landed` and `ambiguous` branch strings, `published` computed with `held_cycle_published` so that a push that completed normally before the crash also releases, and held-guard reporting when the mode is `off` or the ordinal is below 3). Every fenced command line starts with `gh`, `git`, `uv`, `make`, `jq` or a `scripts/` path that exists; every `gh` line is repo-scoped; the text contains no `src/superclaude` string, no python fence and no `file:NNN` pointer. Create `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` with the static checks. As the last step, once the ref text is final, add one `WRITE_VERB_CLASSIFICATION` entry in `tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py` for every line of the ref that matches `gh pr` or `gh api` (exact stripped line, category `never-worker`, the standard pr-submit reason). Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- The ref has a section for each of Engage, Pre-push, Release, Exit report and Resume, states the single place where the guard-enabled cycle id is minted (matching the O1 finding in `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md`), and the Resume section states that it also runs on `--resume` below ordinal 3 and with `--merge-guard off`.
- `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` asserts: the ref exists, its fenced commands pass the allowed-program rule, every `gh` line passes the repo-scope check used in `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py`, `scripts/set-draft-state.sh` is a file, and the ref does not contain `src/superclaude`; the test passes under `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py -q`.
- The ref states that engage failure and an unreadable timeline at engage halt with `terminal_halted` reason `draft_guard_unavailable` before any edit, that an exit with unpublished or uncertain work leaves the PR draft and reports `held`, that the Engage section names the Medium-or-higher routed-finding trigger and "once per cycle", and that Resume uses `published` and the recovery branch strings; the protocol test asserts each of these phrases is present.
- `uv run pytest tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py -q` passes and `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Task 9: Wire the Wave 0 resume and `off` hook, the flag row, the output row and the wave line into `SKILL.md`

Depends on: Task 6
Depends on: Task 8

Edit `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/SKILL.md` additively, using the pins and line-content rules recorded in `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md`: one new bullet under Wave 0, written as a flat line before the Wave 1 bullet, that applies at every ordinal and in both modes and carries no L3 or `draft` condition; it states that on `--resume`, or when the run log already holds guard events, the ref `refs/merge-guard.md` (Resume and Exit report) is loaded before Wave 1 and before any edit, release or re-trigger, and that at L3 with `--merge-guard off` the line "Remediation is unprotected: --merge-guard off." is printed once and no draft call is made. Add one `--merge-guard {draft,off}` row to the Required Input flag table beside `--conflict-max-tier`; one row `merge_guard` to the output table (values `off`, `released`, `held`, `user_override`, `unavailable`) that also carries the literal L2 line "PR #N is still mergeable; this run's fixes are local only." so a fresh L2 run prints it without loading the ref; and one line in the wave-structure list. No new python fence. Where a new line would contain `gh pr` or `gh api`, rephrase it (for example "print the clear command from the ref") so that no classification entry is needed; if one is unavoidable, add its `WRITE_VERB_CLASSIFICATION` entry as the last step. Extend `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` with a test for the Wave 0 bullet (it names `--resume`, sits before the Wave 1 bullet, contains no `L3 only` or `draft` gate wording and contains the literal `off` line), one for the flag row, one for the output row including the literal L2 line, and one for the wave-structure line. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- The Wave 0 test fails when the bullet is placed after the Wave 1 bullet, when it names an L3 or `draft` condition, or when the literal `off` line is missing, and passes on the real file.
- A test asserts the literal text "PR #N is still mergeable; this run's fixes are local only." is present in `SKILL.md` itself (not only in the ref), so a fresh L2 run needs no ref load.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_sync_protocol.py tests/pr_submit/test_cosmos_protocol.py tests/pr_submit/test_codex_reviews.py tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py -q` passes with no edit to any existing test expectation other than those listed in Tasks 2, 5, 7 and 8.
- `SKILL.md` still has exactly one python code fence and no `src/superclaude` string, and the new lines contain neither `evidence-validator` nor `conflict-intent.md`.
- `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Task 10: Wire the Wave 3, Wave 6 and Wave 8 bullets into `SKILL.md` and the overlay note into `refs/state-machine.md`

Depends on: Task 9

Edit `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/SKILL.md` additively: one new bullet under each of Wave 3, Wave 6 and Wave 8 that loads `refs/merge-guard.md` only at L3 with `--merge-guard` `draft`, written as new sentences after, never inside, the pinned sentences. The Wave 3 bullet states that engage happens at the end of Wave 3 only when at least one verified finding of Medium severity or higher is routed to a fix, once per cycle id, and mints the cycle id; the Wave 6 bullet states that Pre-push runs at the pre-push head guard step before `push_decision` and that Release runs after `push_completed` and before reply, resolve and the S5a re-trigger; the Wave 8 bullet states that a CI-fix cycle engages with kind `ci` and releases after `push_completed` before the CI re-poll. The S5a re-trigger sentence and the Wave 6 pre-push sentence stay byte-identical. Edit `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/refs/state-machine.md` with a short overlay note that guard phases are folded values, not `MonitorState` members, without the words `gh` or `git` and outside the wait-only sentences pinned for that file. Avoid `gh pr` and `gh api` on new lines (refer to "the clear command from the ref"); add a `WRITE_VERB_CLASSIFICATION` entry as the last step for any new line that cannot avoid them. Extend `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` with one test per bullet (each gated on L3 and `draft`) and one for the overlay note. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- The Wave 3 bullet test asserts the sentence names the Medium-or-higher routed-finding trigger and "once per cycle" and fails when either phrase is deleted (an unconditional "engage at the end of Wave 3" does not pass); the Wave 6 test asserts the Pre-push sentence and the Release-before-reply-resolve-re-trigger order; the Wave 8 test asserts the CI-fix sentence; each test fails when its sentence is removed.
- The S5a re-trigger sentence and the Wave 6 pre-push sentence are asserted byte-identical by comparing the live text with string constants (the literal start text recorded in `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md`, as the existing pins write them), not with `git show HEAD:`; `SKILL.md` has one python fence and no `src/superclaude` string; no new line contains `evidence-validator` or `conflict-intent.md`.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit -q` and `uv run pytest tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py -q` pass and `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Constraints

- Edit canonical files under `src/superclaude/` only, then run `make sync-dev`; do not stage `.claude/` mirror files. Use UV for every Python command (`uv run pytest ...`, `uv run ruff ...`).
- The new pure module `src/superclaude/pr_submit/merge_guard.py` and every file already listed in `CORE_PURE_FILES` of `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py` (including `refs/state-machine.md` and `refs/loop-guard.md`) must contain no whole word `gh` or `git` on any line, comments included. The module must not import `recovery` (an import cycle through `run_log`).
- Protocol and command text must not contain the string `src/superclaude`; `SKILL.md` must keep exactly one python code fence; edits to `SKILL.md` and `refs/state-machine.md` are additive sentences, bullets and rows placed after, never inside, the sentences pinned by `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py` and `tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_sync_protocol.py`. A new `SKILL.md` line must not name `evidence-validator` or `conflict-intent.md` (a line-content test allows those words only on lines that also say "Tier 2") and must not use wording that the forbidden-force-push line test rejects; Task 1 lists the exact line-content rules before any edit.
- Every new line under `src/superclaude/skills/`, `src/superclaude/commands/` or `src/superclaude/agents/` that contains `gh pr`, `gh api` or a git write verb needs one entry in `WRITE_VERB_CLASSIFICATION` in `tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py` (key: repo-relative path, verb text, exact stripped line; category `never-worker` with the standard pr-submit reason text of the neighbouring entries). Add each entry last in the task that writes the file, because editing a classified line later makes the entry stale and fails `test_classification_table_has_no_stale_entries`; run `uv run pytest tests/skills/test_worker_contract.py -q` in that task.
- Cite tests and constants by symbol name (for example `_NEW_KEY_DEFAULTS`, `_RESOLUTION_SCRIPTS`, `CORE_PURE_FILES`, `WRITE_VERB_CLASSIFICATION`), never by line number, in plan text, task artifacts and the protocol prose this plan produces. Protocol prose carries no `file:NNN` pointers.
- No test or task may call GitHub. Script tests use a fake `gh` executable on `PATH`. The behaviour that needs a disposable fork PR (gates G1 live part, G2 live part, G4, G5 and G6 of ./source.md section 8) is recorded as OPEN and is a release gate, never claimed verified.
- Scope limits (non-goals of ./source.md): no labels, commit statuses or rulesets; ordinals 0 to 2 change only by one report line; conflict-merge cycles (Tier 1 and Tier 2) are never engaged; the guard is not held through re-review or CI; a second concurrent run on the same PR is unsupported.
- Owner decisions already accepted (listed in the ./source.md header and section 8) are fixed: draft not label; engage at the end of Wave 3; default on at `--monitor 3`; release on the confirmed push before replies and the re-trigger; unreadable timeline or unpublished exit keeps the PR draft; build now with no GitHub calls, release gate for G4 and G5.
- Run `make sync-dev` at the end of every task that edits a file under `src/superclaude/skills/` or `src/superclaude/commands/`, because the full test suite runs `make verify-sync` through `tests/cli/test_verify_sync_hooks.py`.
