## Blocking findings

### L3

#### L3.t4-1 (F1)

- claim: The plan forbids edits outside `src/superclaude/` while requiring edits to tests and user-guide files outside that directory, so its instructions cannot all be followed.
- anchor: "Edit canonical files under `src/superclaude/` only, then run `make sync-dev`; do not stage `.claude/` mirror files."
- anchor2: "Edit `docs/user-guide/commands.md`: add `[--merge-guard {draft,off}]` to the `/sc:pr-submit` usage line and a paragraph after the \"Merge conflicts\" paragraph"

## Other findings

- L1 (MAJOR, open, single): The Wave 0 bullet can be read as forbidding any L3 wording while also requiring the at-L3 off sentence, so the test should be specified as rejecting gate wording rather than every L3 mention.
- L2 (MAJOR, open, single): A recorded sentence start cannot by itself prove a full sentence stayed byte-identical, so the plan should state explicitly that the full pinned constants are reused.

## Reviser brief

Blocking finding ids: L3.

Rules for the reviser (restating the Review Loop's Reviser contract): revise only text a blocking finding names; add no rule, mechanism or section no blocking finding calls for; each added paragraph or table cites its finding id; prefer deleting or narrowing to adding; report the byte size before and after, with the bytes added and deleted per finding id.

verdict: FAIL
