## Blocking findings

### L1

#### L1.t2b-1 (F1)

- claim: Task 12 artefact write violates the edit-only constraint or fails its own existence check.
- anchor: "Then write `./artifacts/owner-manual-check.md` in this package."
- anchor2: "Edit only under `src/superclaude/`, `tests/`, `docs/` and `plugins/superclaude/skills/sc-recommend/refs/`"

#### L1.t2b-1 (F6)

- claim: Kept maintainer lines use --repo <owner/repo>, not --repo <R>.
- anchor: "Every `gh issue`, `gh pr` and `gh label` line written into the skill, refs or agents carries `--repo <R>`."
- anchor2: "keep only the `bug` and `enhancement` lines in the maintainer block."

#### L1.t2-1 (F1)

- claim: The mandatory sync writes development copies under .claude while the plan forbids editing them.
- anchor: "Never edit or stage anything under `.claude/` except `.claude/settings.json`; run `make sync-dev` after the `src/superclaude/` edits."

#### L1.t2-1 (F2)

- claim: The required package artifacts must be written outside every permitted edit location.
- anchor: "Edit only under `src/superclaude/`, `tests/`, `docs/` and `plugins/superclaude/skills/sc-recommend/refs/`."
- anchor2: "Then write `./artifacts/owner-manual-check.md` in this package."

#### L1.t2-1 (F3)

- claim: The prescribed command help excludes Test even though the classification rule requires Test for a feature in the tests area.
- anchor: "Picks the feature or bug template, the Feature or Bug issue type and the `enhancement` / `bug` label"
- anchor2: "mode `feature` with area `tests` gives Test"

### L2

#### L2.t2b-1 (F2)

- claim: Task 10 acceptance cannot pass while keeping the allowed gh api user call.
- anchor: "Every `gh api` path in the file spells `repos/<R>/...` except the one documented `orgs/<owner of R>/issue-fields` read."
- anchor2: "every `gh api` path stays `user` or `repos/<R>/...`"

## Other findings

- L3 (MAJOR, open, single): Allowing either orgs spelling weakens the exact-path test and the revert check.
- L4 (MAJOR, open, single): Instruction can be read to delete the negative fixed-set guards.
- L5 (MINOR, open, single): Heading order in Task 4 acceptance differs from create.md Wave 1 order.

## Reviser brief

Blocking finding ids: L1, L2.

Rules for the reviser (restating the Review Loop's Reviser contract): revise only text a blocking finding names; add no rule, mechanism or section no blocking finding calls for; each added paragraph or table cites its finding id; prefer deleting or narrowing to adding; report the byte size before and after, with the bytes added and deleted per finding id.

verdict: FAIL
