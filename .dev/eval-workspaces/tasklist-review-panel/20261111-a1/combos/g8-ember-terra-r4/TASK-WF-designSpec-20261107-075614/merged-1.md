## Ledger

| lid | status | blocking | confidence | severity | refs | reviewers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | open | no | single | MAJOR | - | t2b-1 |
| L2 | open | no | single | MAJOR | - | t2b-1 |
| L3 | open | no | single | MINOR | - | t2b-1 |

## Blocking findings

none.

## Other findings

- L1 (MAJOR, open, single): Wave 0 bullet naming L3 for the off line can be read as the L3 condition the test must reject
- L2 (MAJOR, open, single): Enumeration can reach 45 by label while its decomposition arithmetic still sums to the old total
- L3 (MINOR, open, single): Acceptance example names n == 0 where the contract requires n < 1, leaving negative n unstated in the example

## Reviser brief

Blocking finding ids: none.

Rules for the reviser (restating the Review Loop's Reviser contract): revise only text a blocking finding names; add no rule, mechanism or section no blocking finding calls for; each added paragraph or table cites its finding id; prefer deleting or narrowing to adding; report the byte size before and after, with the bytes added and deleted per finding id.

verdict: PASS
