# Implement the /sc:pr-submit merge guard (issue #375)

Source: ./source.md
Goal: With `/sc:pr-submit --monitor 3`, a PR is turned into a draft as soon as a verified Medium-or-higher finding is routed to a fix, and is marked ready again only when that cycle's fix push is confirmed on the PR head (or a zero-edit cycle is proven), with every failure, override, crash, resume and exit path leaving the PR in a known, reported state.

## Constraints

- Edit canonical files under `src/superclaude/` only, then run `make sync-dev`; do not stage `.claude/` mirror files. Use UV for every Python command (`uv run pytest ...`, `uv run ruff ...`).
- The new pure module `src/superclaude/pr_submit/merge_guard.py` and every file already listed in `CORE_PURE_FILES` of `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py` (including `refs/state-machine.md` and `refs/loop-guard.md`) must contain no whole word `gh` or `git` on any line, comments included.
- Protocol and command text must not contain the string `src/superclaude`; `SKILL.md` must keep exactly one python code fence; edits to `SKILL.md` and `refs/state-machine.md` are additive sentences, bullets and rows placed after, never inside, the sentences pinned by `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py` and `tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_sync_protocol.py`. A new `SKILL.md` line must not name `evidence-validator` or `conflict-intent.md` (a line-content test allows those words only on lines that also say "Tier 2") and must not use wording that the forbidden-force-push line test rejects; Task 1 lists the exact line-content rules before any edit.
- Cite tests and constants by symbol name (for example `_NEW_KEY_DEFAULTS`, `_RESOLUTION_SCRIPTS`, `CORE_PURE_FILES`), never by line number, in plan text, task artifacts and the protocol prose this plan produces. Protocol prose carries no `file:NNN` pointers.
- No test or task may call GitHub. Script tests use a fake `gh` executable on `PATH`. The behaviour that needs a disposable fork PR (gates G1 live part, G2 live part, G4, G5 and G6 of ./source.md section 8) is recorded as OPEN and is a release gate, never claimed verified.
- Scope limits (non-goals of ./source.md): no labels, commit statuses or rulesets; ordinals 0 to 2 change only by one report line; conflict-merge cycles (Tier 1 and Tier 2) are never engaged; the guard is not held through re-review or CI; a second concurrent run on the same PR is unsupported.
- Owner decisions already accepted (listed in the ./source.md header and section 8) are fixed: draft not label; engage at the end of Wave 3; default on at `--monitor 3`; release on the confirmed push before replies and the re-trigger; unreadable timeline or unpublished exit keeps the PR draft; build now with no GitHub calls, release gate for G4 and G5.
- Run `make sync-dev` at the end of every task that edits a file under `src/superclaude/skills/` or `src/superclaude/commands/`, because the full test suite runs `make verify-sync` through `tests/cli/test_verify_sync_hooks.py`.

## Phase 1: Contracts and pure core

## Task 1: Write the pre-build record `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md`

Create `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md` in this package from ./source.md sections 6, 8 and 10. First record the base-commit state: run `make lint` and `uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/` before any code edit and write each exit code and the first failing lines (if any) into the file, so later failures can be told apart from this feature's. Then record the release-gate decision of ./source.md section 8 in the owner's words: the build proceeds with no GitHub calls (fake `gh` in tests); gates G1 (live part), G2 (live part), G4, G5 and G6 are a release gate that the owner runs on a disposable fork PR before the feature is merged or turned on by default; the user guide states that draft behaviour is unverified until then; the PR body states the gate plainly; the run that opens the PR must pass `--merge-guard off`. Then close the open items by reading the code: O1, where `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/SKILL.md` (Wave 3 to Wave 6 and Wave 8 text) and `refs/loop-guard.md` assign a fix or CI cycle's `cycle_id` today and whether any test under `tests/pr_submit/` pins a value; O2, how scripts are granted and invoked in the SKILL front matter and what `test_allowed_tools_cover_every_program` in `tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_sync_protocol.py` and the `_RESOLUTION_SCRIPTS` tests in `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py` require of a new script; O3, every exact-text pin and line-content rule (for example `test_intent_and_validator_lines_say_tier_2`, `test_skill_forbids_force_push`, the wait-only sentences pinned for `refs/state-machine.md`) on `SKILL.md`, `refs/state-machine.md`, `refs/loop-guard.md` and `src/superclaude/commands/pr-submit.md` that the later additive edits must avoid; O4, that the S5a re-trigger sentence in `SKILL.md` stays unchanged and where the new release sentence goes relative to it.

Acceptance criteria:
- `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md` has the base-commit lint record (two commands, exit codes, failing lines or "clean") and one row each for G1 to G6: G1 to G3 `CONFIRMED` for the locally verifiable part with the evidence named in ./source.md, G1 and G2 live parts, G4, G5 and G6 `OPEN` as a release gate with the owner decision quoted.
- O1 to O4 each carry the finding with the file and symbol read in this task (no bare line numbers); O1 names one single place where the guard-enabled cycle id is minted so the push triad and `rereview_requested` use the same id, or states that no id is minted today and which sentence will mint it.
- The file lists every exact-text pin and line-content rule found for O3, so Tasks 8, 9, 10 and 12 can avoid them; no GitHub or network call is made.

## Task 2: Add the two guard events to the closed event enum and the enumeration texts

Depends on: Task 1

Edit `src/superclaude/pr_submit/models.py`: add `DRAFT_GUARD_REQUESTED = "draft_guard_requested"` and `DRAFT_GUARD_SETTLED = "draft_guard_settled"` to `EventType` (a comment block like the conflict-cycle one), and change the module docstring and the `EventType` class docstring from "exactly 43 members" to 45, naming the new events. Edit the `RunLog.append` docstring in `src/superclaude/pr_submit/run_log.py` that says "43 closed" to 45. Edit `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/refs/loop-guard.md`: its heading "The 43 event types" and the sentence that says the enum has EXACTLY 43 members become 45 and name `draft_guard_requested` and `draft_guard_settled`, without the whole words `gh` or `git` (the file is in `CORE_PURE_FILES`). Update `tests/pr_submit/test_run_log.py` (the test `test_eventtype_is_43_members_with_silence_reviewer_and_conflict_events`: rename it to describe 45 members, assert both lengths are 45 and both new values are present) and the `len(EventType)` assertion in `tests/pr_submit/test_codex_reviews.py` to 45. Leave `tests/pr_submit/test_idempotency.py` (7 sets) unchanged. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_run_log.py tests/pr_submit/test_codex_reviews.py tests/pr_submit/test_idempotency.py tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py -q` passes with `len(EventType) == 45` and the two new values asserted.
- `RunLog.append` accepts an event with `event_type: "draft_guard_requested"` and still rejects an unknown type, with the updated count in the error message.
- `grep -rn "43" src/superclaude/pr_submit/models.py src/superclaude/pr_submit/run_log.py src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/refs/loop-guard.md` shows no remaining claim that the enum has 43 members, and `refs/loop-guard.md` names both new event values.
- `make verify-sync` exits 0 after the sync.

## Task 3: Create `merge_guard.py` types, cycle ids, fold, pending matcher and status mapping

Depends on: Task 2

Create `src/superclaude/pr_submit/merge_guard.py` following ./source.md sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.6: `GuardMode`, `Direction`, `Phase`, `GuardAction`, `GuardRead`, `GuardDecision`; `fix_cycle_id(kind, n)` and `next_cycle_number(events, kind)` (never colliding with `CONFLICT_CYCLE_PREFIXES` from `src/superclaude/pr_submit/conflicts.py`); `fold_draft_guard(events)` implementing every row of the section 4.2 effect table (fields `phase, phase_before_request, cycle_id, original_is_draft, baseline, run_toggles, unsettled, failed_mutations, owned_draft, disabled_cause`; `None` when no guard record exists; `original_is_draft` taken only from the first guard record or a first skip, never from a later read); `pending_requests(events)` matching requests to settles by `idempotency_key`; `guard_status(guard, mode, ordinal)` implementing the first-match mapping of section 4.1 (`off`, `released`, `held`, `user_override`, `unavailable`). The module imports only `enum`, `dataclasses`, `re` and `is_conflict_cycle` from `.conflicts`, and contains no `gh` or `git` word on any line. Create `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard.py` with table tests for these functions.

Acceptance criteria:
- `fix_cycle_id("fix", 2) == "fix-2"`, `fix_cycle_id("ci", 1) == "ci-1"`, `ValueError` for kind `sync` and for `n == 0`, `is_conflict_cycle(...)` is false for both kinds; `next_cycle_number` returns 1 on an empty log and 3 after `fix-1` and `fix-2` appear in event `cycle_id` fields.
- A parametrized fold test covers every row of the section 4.2 effect table, and each of these cases fails if the row is implemented wrongly: `settled(draft, skipped, not_applied)` clears the pending key and restores `phase_before_request` (`RELEASED`, or `None` result when no guard existed before) and is not `DISABLED`; `settled(draft, confirmed, not changed)` gives `HELD` with `owned_draft` true and no toggle; `settled(ready, confirmed, not changed)` adds no toggle; `settled(draft, failed)` gives `RELEASE_PENDING`, increments `failed_mutations` and leaves `owned_draft` unchanged; `settled(draft, skipped, already_draft)` gives `DISABLED` with `disabled_cause == "already_draft"`; a log with no guard events returns `None`.
- A `guard_status` test covers every phase and cause of the first-match mapping, including `ENGAGE_PENDING` and `RELEASE_PENDING` with `owned_draft` true (`held`) and false (`unavailable`), `DISABLED` with `user_override` (`user_override`) and with `already_draft` (`off`), mode `OFF` and ordinal below 3 with no record (`off`), and no record at ordinal 3 (`released`).
- `pending_requests` returns exactly the requests whose key has no settle, with retries distinguished by the `:a<k>` suffix; a static test asserts `merge_guard.py` has no whole word `gh` or `git`.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard.py -q` passes and `uv run ruff check` and `uv run ruff format --check` are clean for both new files.

## Task 4: Add the toggle classifier and the three decision functions

Depends on: Task 3

In `src/superclaude/pr_submit/merge_guard.py` add `classify_toggles(guard, read)` (the exact rule of ./source.md section 4.1: `unreadable` for a failed, incomplete or short timeline, `foreign` when observed transitions exceed `run_toggles + unsettled + failed_mutations` or the live draft flag contradicts a `HELD` or `RELEASED` phase, `ok` otherwise), `engage_decision(*, mode, ordinal, cycle_id, guard, read)` (all 11 rows, first match wins, `notes` carries `auto_merge_armed`), `release_decision(*, mode, ordinal, cycle_id, guard, read, applied_edits, target_sha, push_completed)` (all 9 rows; `applied_edits` is the count of edits applied in THIS cycle, not the run-wide output field) and `resume_decision(*, mode, ordinal, guard, read, pending, dangling_branch)` (all 9 rows, with the row 2 precedence and the three `RECONCILE` reasons `resume_reconciled`, `not_applied`, `ambiguous` of section 4.1). Extend `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard.py` with one parametrized case per table row, the ready-then-draft round trip, and a failed-on-client-but-landed mutation that must not classify as foreign.

Acceptance criteria:
- Each row of the three decision tables has a test that names the row number and asserts the returned `action`, `reason` and `cause`; the engage test at ordinal 2, with `mode=OFF`, and with cycle id `sync-1` and `conflict-1` all return `NOOP`.
- `classify_toggles` returns `unreadable` for `complete=False`, `transitions=None` and for observed below `run_toggles`, `foreign` for one extra transition and for a `HELD` phase with a ready PR, and `ok` when observed equals `run_toggles + failed_mutations`.
- `release_decision` called with `applied_edits=0` for a new cycle while the guard record already holds an earlier fixing cycle returns `RELEASE` with cause `no_edits`; it returns `HOLD` for a head different from `target_sha`, and `HALT_PR_NOT_OPEN` for a merged state; a guard in phase `DISABLED` (originally draft) never yields `RELEASE` or `ENGAGE`.
- `resume_decision` tests prove the precedence: ordinal 2 with phase `ENGAGE_PENDING` and a non-empty `pending` returns `REPORT_HELD` (row 2 wins over row 3); mode `OFF` at ordinal 3 with phase `HELD` returns `REPORT_HELD`; phases `RELEASED` and `DISABLED` skip row 2; ordinal 3 with `pending` non-empty returns `RECONCILE` with a distinct test for each of `resume_reconciled` (live state matches the request and observed equals `run_toggles + 1`), `not_applied` (live state does not match) and `ambiguous` (anything else, which holds).
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard.py -q` passes with ruff clean.

## Task 5: Fold the guard into the run log and export the public names

Depends on: Task 3
Depends on: Task 4

Edit `src/superclaude/pr_submit/run_log.py` `rebuild_state()` so `state["draft_guard"]` is `fold_draft_guard(events)` (default `None`, documented in the method docstring beside the #305 keys), importing from `src/superclaude/pr_submit/merge_guard.py`. Add the public guard names (the enums, dataclasses, `fix_cycle_id`, `next_cycle_number`, `fold_draft_guard`, `pending_requests`, `classify_toggles`, `engage_decision`, `release_decision`, `resume_decision`, `guard_status`) to the imports and `__all__` of `src/superclaude/pr_submit/__init__.py`. Update `tests/pr_submit/test_run_log.py`: add `"draft_guard": None` to `_NEW_KEY_DEFAULTS` and add a test that a legacy log rebuilds every old key unchanged with `draft_guard` `None`, and that a log with a request and a confirmed settle rebuilds `phase: held`. Add `src/superclaude/pr_submit/merge_guard.py` to `CORE_PURE_FILES` in `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py`.

Acceptance criteria:
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_run_log.py tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py tests/pr_submit/test_idempotency.py -q` passes, including `test_tn50_core_pure_no_gh_git_tokens` over the new file and the exact key-set assertions that use `_NEW_KEY_DEFAULTS`.
- `uv run python -c "from superclaude.pr_submit import fold_draft_guard, engage_decision, release_decision, resume_decision, fix_cycle_id; import superclaude.pr_submit.run_log"` exits 0 in a fresh interpreter (no import cycle).
- Rebuilding a log that holds `requested(draft)` then `settled(draft, confirmed, changed=True)` returns `state["draft_guard"]["phase"] == "held"` with `owned_draft` true; a log that ends after only the request returns `unsettled == 1` and phase `engage_pending`.

## Phase 2: Flag and script

## Task 6: Add the `--merge-guard` flag

Depends on: Task 1

Edit `src/superclaude/pr_submit/fsm.py` following ./source.md section 4.3: `DEFAULT_MERGE_GUARD = "draft"`, a `--merge-guard` argument with `dest="merge_guard"` and `choices=["draft", "off"]` placed beside `--conflict-max-tier` in `build_arg_parser`, `SkillArgs.merge_guard: str = DEFAULT_MERGE_GUARD`, and `parse_args` passing `ns.merge_guard`. Leave `RunConfig` and `run_skill` unchanged. Add a test beside `test_conflict_max_tier_default_and_bounds` in `tests/pr_submit/test_skill_parse.py`.

Acceptance criteria:
- `parse_args([]).merge_guard == "draft"`, `parse_args(["--merge-guard", "off"]).merge_guard == "off"`, `SkillArgs().merge_guard == "draft"`, and `--merge-guard label` exits with an argparse error (`SystemExit`).
- `fsm.py` still contains no whole word `gh` or `git` (the static purity test passes) and every existing test in `tests/pr_submit/test_skill_parse.py` and `tests/pr_submit/test_autonomy_gates.py` passes unchanged.

## Task 7: Create the GitHub I/O script `set-draft-state.sh`

Depends on: Task 1

Create `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/scripts/set-draft-state.sh` following ./source.md section 4.4 and modelled on `scripts/retrigger-review.sh` (same `die`, `--repo` resolution from the origin remote, numeric `--pr` check, exit 127 when `gh` or `jq` is missing, executable bit). Modes `--read` and `--to draft|ready` with the exact calls, the one-line JSON shapes and the exit codes 0, 1, 2, 127 of section 4.4; every `gh` call carries `--repo "$REPO"` or a `repos/${REPO}/...` path; the timeline count uses `gh api --paginate` with a `jq` filter on `convert_to_draft` and `ready_for_review` piped to `wc -l`; `--to` re-reads state first (non-`OPEN` gives `error:"not_open"`), is idempotent (`changed:false` when already in the target state) and verifies after the mutation (`verify_failed`). Create `tests/pr_submit/test_set_draft_state.py` using a fake `gh` on `PATH` that logs its arguments (the fake-executable approach of `tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_scripts.py`). Add the script to `_RESOLUTION_SCRIPTS` in `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py` only after reading the purpose of that list (Task 1 O2), and to any script list that Task 1 O2 shows is required for a new script. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- Fake-`gh` tests assert: `--read` prints one JSON line with `ok`, `state`, `isDraft`, `headRefOid`, `autoMergeRequest`, `transitions`, `complete`; a failing timeline call prints `transitions: null` and `complete: false`; `--to draft` on a draft PR makes no `pr ready` call and prints `changed:false`; `--to ready` on a merged PR prints `ok:false` with `error:"not_open"`; a mismatch after the mutation prints `ok:false` with `error:"verify_failed"`.
- Exit codes are asserted: 0 on success, 1 on a failing `gh` (JSON still printed with `ok:false`), 2 for a missing or non-numeric `--pr` and for an unknown argument, 127 with `gh` absent from `PATH`.
- The recorded fake-`gh` argument log shows `--repo` or a `repos/` path on every call, and the script passes the `_RESOLUTION_SCRIPTS` origin-URL resolution tests and the runtime repo-pin static check.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_set_draft_state.py tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_sync_protocol.py -q` passes and `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Phase 3: Protocol text

## Task 8: Write the protocol reference `refs/merge-guard.md`

Depends on: Task 1
Depends on: Task 4
Depends on: Task 7

Create `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/refs/merge-guard.md` from ./source.md sections 3, 4.1, 4.5, 4.6 and 5, as protocol steps (read with `scripts/set-draft-state.sh --read`, decide with `superclaude.pr_submit.merge_guard`, append the `draft_guard_requested` event with fsync before the call, run `scripts/set-draft-state.sh --to`, append `draft_guard_settled`) for: Engage at the end of Wave 3 (L3, review-fix cycles and CI-fix cycles; mints the cycle id with `fix_cycle_id` in the single place named by Task 1 O1 and reuses it as the `cycle_id` of the push triad and of `rereview_requested`; prints the clear command `gh pr ready <N> --repo "$REPO"` once); Pre-push (the script `--read` must show `OPEN` at the pre-push head guard step before `push_decision`, otherwise halt `pr_not_open`, push nothing, report the local commit); Release (after `push_completed`, head equals `target_sha`, or zero-edit proof with this cycle's applied-edit count, before reply, resolve and the S5a re-trigger; one retry; `already in target state` counts as confirmed); Foreign toggle and unreadable timeline handling; Exit report (the `merge_guard` field mapping of `guard_status` and the held-exit list with the clear command, and at L2 the line "PR #N is still mergeable; this run's fixes are local only."); Resume, loaded from Wave 0 at every ordinal and in both modes (`resume_decision` rows, the three `RECONCILE` reasons, Branch A, B and C, and held-guard reporting when the mode is `off` or the ordinal is below 3). Every fenced command line starts with `gh`, `git`, `uv`, `make`, `jq` or a `scripts/` path that exists; every `gh` line is repo-scoped; the text contains no `src/superclaude` string, no python fence and no `file:NNN` pointer. Create `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` with the static checks. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- The ref has a section for each of Engage, Pre-push, Release, Exit report and Resume, states the single place where the guard-enabled cycle id is minted (matching the O1 finding in `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md`), and the Resume section states that it also runs on `--resume` below ordinal 3 and with `--merge-guard off`.
- `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` asserts: the ref exists, its fenced commands pass the allowed-program rule, every `gh` line passes the repo-scope check used in `tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py`, `scripts/set-draft-state.sh` is a file, and the ref does not contain `src/superclaude`; the test passes under `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py -q`.
- The ref states that engage failure and an unreadable timeline at engage halt with `terminal_halted` reason `draft_guard_unavailable` before any edit, and that an exit with unpublished or uncertain work leaves the PR draft and reports `held`.
- `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Task 9: Wire the Wave 0 resume and `off` hook, the flag row, the output row and the wave line into `SKILL.md`

Depends on: Task 6
Depends on: Task 8

Edit `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/SKILL.md` additively, using the pins and line-content rules recorded in `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md`: one new bullet under Wave 0 that applies at every ordinal and in both modes; it states that on `--resume`, or when the run log already holds guard events, the ref `refs/merge-guard.md` (Resume and Exit report) is loaded before Wave 1 and before any edit, release or re-trigger, and that at L3 with `--merge-guard off` the line "Remediation is unprotected: --merge-guard off." is printed once and no draft call is made. Add one `--merge-guard {draft,off}` row to the Required Input flag table beside `--conflict-max-tier`; one row `merge_guard` to the output table (values `off`, `released`, `held`, `user_override`, `unavailable`); and one line in the wave-structure list. No new python fence. Extend `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` with a test for the Wave 0 bullet (it names `--resume`, is not gated on L3 or on `draft`, and contains the literal `off` line), one for the flag row, one for the output row and one for the wave-structure line. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- The new Wave 0 test fails when the bullet is moved under a Wave 3 or L3-only heading or when the literal `off` line is missing, and passes on the real file.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit/test_static_grep.py tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_sync_protocol.py tests/pr_submit/test_cosmos_protocol.py tests/pr_submit/test_codex_reviews.py tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py -q` passes with no edit to any existing test expectation other than those listed in Tasks 2, 5 and 7.
- `SKILL.md` still has exactly one python code fence and no `src/superclaude` string, and the new lines contain neither `evidence-validator` nor `conflict-intent.md`.
- `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Task 10: Wire the Wave 3, Wave 6 and Wave 8 bullets into `SKILL.md` and the overlay note into `refs/state-machine.md`

Depends on: Task 9

Edit `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/SKILL.md` additively: one new bullet under each of Wave 3, Wave 6 and Wave 8 that loads `refs/merge-guard.md` only at L3 with `--merge-guard` `draft`, written as new sentences after, never inside, the pinned sentences. The Wave 3 bullet states that engage happens at the end of Wave 3 and mints the cycle id; the Wave 6 bullet states that Pre-push runs at the pre-push head guard step before `push_decision` and that Release runs after `push_completed` and before reply, resolve and the S5a re-trigger; the Wave 8 bullet states that a CI-fix cycle engages with kind `ci` and releases after `push_completed` before the CI re-poll. The S5a re-trigger sentence stays byte-identical. Edit `src/superclaude/skills/sc-pr-submit-protocol/refs/state-machine.md` with a short overlay note that guard phases are folded values, not `MonitorState` members, without the words `gh` or `git` and outside the wait-only sentences pinned for that file. Extend `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` with one test per bullet (including that each of the three bullets is gated on L3 and `draft`) and one for the overlay note. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- The three bullet tests assert the Wave 3 engage sentence, the Wave 6 Pre-push and Release order sentences (Release before reply, resolve and re-trigger) and the Wave 8 CI-fix sentence, and fail when a sentence is removed.
- The S5a re-trigger sentence and the Wave 6 pre-push sentence are byte-identical to before (compare against `git show HEAD:` of the file in the test or in the task evidence); `SKILL.md` has one python fence and no `src/superclaude` string; no new line contains `evidence-validator` or `conflict-intent.md`.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit -q` passes and `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Phase 4: Scenario tests

## Task 11: Write the scenario tests over the run log

Depends on: Task 4
Depends on: Task 5
Depends on: Task 7

Create `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_scenarios.py` with a small test driver that applies the pure decisions of `merge_guard.py`, appends events to a real `RunLog` in a temporary directory and runs `scripts/set-draft-state.sh` against a fake `gh` (reuse the fake from `tests/pr_submit/test_set_draft_state.py`). Implement the twelve test names of ./source.md section 7 and the acceptance trace of section 5. Cover the cases of the section 5 table: engage failure halts before any edit, validation failure leaves phase `held`, zero-edit cycle releases with `no_edits` (including a zero-edit cycle after a fixing cycle), foreign toggle disables the guard and the run continues, crash between request and settle reconciles on resume (including `not_applied` followed by a normal re-engage), crash after `push_completed` releases on Branch A and holds on Branch B and C, merged PR halts `pr_not_open`, ordinals 0 to 2 and `off` make no call, an originally draft PR is never made ready, an engage, crash, resume with live draft true stays `held` and is released after the push, and a conflict-cycle id never engages.

Acceptance criteria:
- The test file defines `test_guard_modes_ordinals_and_resume_authority`, `test_attach_and_create_preserve_preexisting_draft`, `test_guard_engages_at_routed_finding_once_per_cycle`, `test_guard_releases_only_after_publication_or_zero_edit_proof`, `test_guard_holds_on_unpublished_or_uncertain_exits`, `test_guard_engage_failure_blocks_edits`, `test_guard_release_failure_retries_once_and_reports`, `test_guard_external_toggle_and_roundtrip_disable`, `test_guard_missing_timeline_or_ambiguous_intent_never_readies`, `test_guard_crash_boundaries_and_push_recovery_abc`, `test_guard_closed_merged_or_moved_head_forbids_mutation` and `test_guard_script_contract_scoping_and_legacy_fold` (the last may import the Task 7 tests by reference rather than duplicate them).
- The acceptance-trace test asserts the exact event order `draft_guard_requested(draft)`, `draft_guard_settled(confirmed)`, `fix_applied`, `push_completed`, `draft_guard_requested(ready)`, `draft_guard_settled(confirmed)`, `rereview_requested` from `RunLog.read_events()` and asserts no `rereview_requested` appears before the release settle.
- Forbidden-call assertions: the fake `gh` log never contains `pr ready` without `--undo` for an originally draft PR, never contains any `pr ready` call at ordinal 2 or with `off`, and never contains a push-related call after a `pr_not_open` halt.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit -q` passes in full.

## Phase 5: Command and user docs

## Task 12: Document the flag in the command file

Depends on: Task 6
Depends on: Task 8

Edit `src/superclaude/commands/pr-submit.md`, using the pins recorded in `./artifacts/pre-build-gate.md`: add `[--merge-guard {draft,off}]` to the `argument-hint` front matter line (after `--conflict-max-tier`), a row `--merge-guard {draft,off}` with default `draft` in the Options table (effective only at `--monitor 3`; `off` prints "Remediation is unprotected: --merge-guard off."), and a short "Merge guard" section next to "Merge-conflict handling" covering: when the PR becomes a draft, when it becomes ready, the held outcome and the clear command, the unreadable-timeline rule, and that drafts and ready transitions may affect reviewers and workflows (gates G4 and G5 are OPEN and not claimed verified, the PR body states the release gate). The text must not contain `src/superclaude`. Extend `tests/pr_submit/test_merge_guard_protocol.py` with assertions for the flag row, the argument-hint entry and the new section. Run `make sync-dev`.

Acceptance criteria:
- `grep -n "merge-guard" src/superclaude/commands/pr-submit.md` shows the argument-hint entry, the Options row and the section heading, and the section states default-on at monitor 3, the exact clear command and that the behaviour is unverified until the owner's disposable-PR run.
- `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit -q` passes, including the command-file checks in `tests/pr_submit/test_conflict_sync_protocol.py`, and `make verify-sync` exits 0.

## Task 13: Document the flag in the user guides, sync, and run the final checks

Depends on: Task 2
Depends on: Task 10
Depends on: Task 11
Depends on: Task 12

Edit `docs/user-guide/commands.md`: add `[--merge-guard {draft,off}]` to the `/sc:pr-submit` usage line and a paragraph after the "Merge conflicts" paragraph describing the guard, its default, the `held` state, the clear command `gh pr ready <N> --repo <REPO>` and that draft behaviour is unverified until the owner runs the disposable-PR gate. Edit `docs/user-guide/flags.md`: add a `--merge-guard` row beside the `--conflict-max-tier` row with values `draft` (default) and `off`. Then run `make sync-dev`, `make verify-sync`, `make lint`, `uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/`, `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit -q` and `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_verify_sync_hooks.py tests/unit/test_cli_install.py -q`, and write the outputs and any failure that also appears in the base-commit record of Task 1 to `./artifacts/final-checks.md`.

Acceptance criteria:
- `grep -n "merge-guard" docs/user-guide/commands.md docs/user-guide/flags.md` shows the usage entry, the paragraph and the flags row; the paragraph names the clear command and the unverified-until-release-gate statement.
- `make verify-sync` exits 0, `uv run pytest tests/pr_submit -q` passes and `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_verify_sync_hooks.py tests/unit/test_cli_install.py -q` passes; `make lint` and `uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/` exit 0, or every remaining failure is listed in `./artifacts/final-checks.md` as present in the base-commit record of Task 1.
- `git status --short` lists changes only under `src/superclaude/`, `tests/`, `docs/user-guide/`, `.dev/` and gitignored `.claude/` mirrors; no `.claude/` path other than `.claude/settings.json` is staged, and `.dev/tasks` is staged with `git add .dev/tasks`.
