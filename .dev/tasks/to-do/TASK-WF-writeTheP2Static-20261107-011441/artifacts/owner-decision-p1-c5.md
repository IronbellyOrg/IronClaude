# Owner decision P1-C5 (2026-11-07): ANSWERED, NO

Recorded here, not in the plan, because the plan is hash-pinned by the ledger after the first `T<id>: start` line (`E-PLAN-CHANGED`; `refs/managed-workspace.md` of the implement protocol). This file supersedes every plan sentence that calls P1-C5 open:

- Constraints, bullet "Open owner question, listed and not decided here (P1-C5)".
- Constraints, bullet "Owner decisions of 2026-11-07", item (3).
- Task 21, the report requirement "the open owner question P1-C5 (WC-7 and the Skill-call question), stated in full".

## The decision

A worker that carries a command out by reading its file, with no `Skill` call, does NOT satisfy WC-7. The command must be run for real: a `Skill` or slash-command call, at the top level. P1-C5 is therefore decided, not open, and no task in this plan changes.

## What follows

- The P2 live plan must make spec section 7.2 step 5 condition 2 require the `Skill` or slash-command call, and must fail a worker that made none.
- The static report (Task 21) states P1-C5 as decided and lists these follow-ups, none of which this task edits (the spec, `decisions/APPROVED.md` and the P1 reports stay untouched):
  - (a) the `APPROVED.md` row for P1-C5;
  - (b) the wording of spec section 7.2 step 5;
  - (c) owner accepted the 11 P1 rows (lc01, lc02, lc04, lc05, lc06, lc07, lc08, lc14, lc17, lc18, lc22) recorded PASS on condition 2, as they stand; P1 is not reopened and nothing is re-run; add this to the `APPROVED.md` row for P1-C5.

The ruling itself holds for P2 and later phases: the command must be run for real (a `Skill` or slash-command call).
