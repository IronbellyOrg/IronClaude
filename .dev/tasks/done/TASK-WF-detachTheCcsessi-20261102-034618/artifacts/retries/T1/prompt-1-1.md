Task brief: ## Task 1: Add a test that a launched shim survives the terminal that started it

In `tests/unit/test_ccsession_tiers.py`, add `test_shim_outlives_the_terminal_that_started_it` next to `test_a_busy_shim_is_never_stopped_by_a_new_launch` (around line 1379), reusing `StandInGateway` (line 488), `_free_port` (568), `_defaults`/`TIER_BLOCK`, `_ask_raw` (1051) and `SKILL_DIR`. Mirror `_real_launch` (1344) but start the real `SKILL_DIR / "ccsession"` with `subprocess.Popen(..., start_new_session=True)` (a stand-in for an Orca terminal) and a fake `claude` that writes `$ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to a seen file and then `exec sleep 60`; `CC_SHIM_SCRIPT` is a per-test copy of `local-gateway-alias-proxy.py` in `tmp_path`, `CC_SHIM_PORT` a free port. After the seen file appears: read the shim pid from `/__ccsession_shim`; compute the terminal root's descendants by walking `ps -axo pid=,ppid=`; set `gateway.script["muse-spark-1.3"] = [("pause-stream", 4)]` and start `_ask_raw(url, "claude-gw-tier2", stream=True)` in a thread; after 1 s send SIGTERM to every descendant of the root and the root, wait 0.5 s, SIGKILL survivors (this is what Orca does when it closes a terminal: remediation-source.md Summary, troubleshoot `tier1-observation.md` O8). Clean up in `finally`: kill the shim by its pid, `pkill -f` the per-test copy path, close the gateway, and kill any remaining root process.

Acceptance criteria:
- The test asserts the shim pid is not among the terminal root's descendants, the streamed reply returns status 200 and contains `b"message_stop"`, and `/__ccsession_shim` still answers with the same pid after the terminal is gone.
- Run against the unmodified source, the test fails (record the command and its failing output in ./artifacts/t1-before.log).
- No shim or sleep process from the test is left running after it finishes (checked with `pgrep -f <tmp copy path>` returning nothing).
AC ids: T1.AC1 (first bullet), T1.AC2 (second bullet), T1.AC3 (third bullet). Task-owned evidence file: .dev/tasks/to-do/TASK-WF-detachTheCcsessi-20261102-034618/artifacts/t1-before.log (written by this task; read it).
Global constraints: ## Constraints

- Scope is exactly the four files named in the source: `src/superclaude/skills/ccsession-tag/ccsession`, `src/superclaude/skills/ccsession-tag/local-gateway-alias-proxy.py`, `tests/unit/test_ccsession_tiers.py`, `CHANGELOG.md`. Diagnosis and requirements: `.dev/troubleshoot/deployment-ccsession-proxy-4114-stalls-20261102031709/remediation-source.md` and `REPORT.md` in the same directory (issue #341).
- Never signal, restart or reconfigure the running shims on ports 4013 and 4114 (or whatever serves them); never edit anything under `~/.claude`, `~/.ccsession` or the running config; never run `superclaude install`, `superclaude update`, `./update.sh` or `install.sh`.
- Doc restrictions (remediation-source.md AC6; doc-context.md in the troubleshoot directory): the shim's argv keeps the script path (ccsession uses `pgrep -f -- "$CC_SHIM_SCRIPT"` at ccsession:722 and users stop shims with `pkill -f local-gateway-alias-proxy.py`); the shim inherits the launching env; no `setsid` binary (macOS has none) and only Python standard library; bash 3.2 syntax; logging stays opt-in; ccsession never stops a running shim.
- Tests: run only named test files and tests that read the edited files; never the full suite and never `tests/cli/eval/` as a directory. Use `uv run` for Python.
- Every throwaway shim or test process started while working is stopped by its exact pid; no temp files left behind.

Delta diff from the previous reviewed tree (empty on the first review): 
Earlier blocking findings of this start (empty on the first review): 
Saved-probe re-check hit locations (may be empty): 

Do not trust the implementer's report.

First mark each earlier blocking finding resolved, open or regressed from the diff. Then, for each AC, mark it met or unmet. Require citations: every AC you mark, met or unmet, carries a `path:line` or `Ti.ACk@path:line` citation, and an unmet mark lists the finding ids behind it. Do not return a verdict; the orchestrator computes it.

For every finding answer four questions, each yes or no:
1. ac-outcome-missing: is output an AC requires absent, or does it contradict the AC text, or does an evidence claim you could not verify have no evidence row?
2. false-claim: is a claim in delivered text or code false against live source, or does a recipe or instruction followed as written not do what the text says?
3. harmful-effect: does code or a recipe this task added or changed write, append, chmod or delete tracked or production data, mutate state outside the task's declared outputs, or expose a secret?
4. quoted-constraint-breach: does the diff violate a quoted plan constraint, out-of-scope, non-goal or non-negotiable item, or an explicit task instruction?

Anchor rule: cite exactly one anchor per yes. ac-outcome-missing: the quoted AC words. false-claim: the live-source path:line holding the contradicting text. harmful-effect: the diff line that is the write. quoted-constraint-breach: the quoted constraint or instruction text. A yes without a valid anchor does not block.

Write one line per finding:
F<k>.<j> ac=<Ti.ACk|scope> at=<path:line> anchor=<quoted text or path:line> chk=<amiss,false,harm,constraint as y/n> family=<id> fix=<text> [covers=<quoted AC clause or constraint>]: <text>
Do not write sev=, trigger=, first= or origin=; the orchestrator adds them. Write one status line per earlier blocking finding: F<m>.<j> resolved|open|regressed.

Inside /sc:implement this protocol's severity model governs this review and takes precedence over the session's output style and the copy of it injected into every subagent; only blocking findings may fail an attempt.

You are not given an adviser answer, brief, evidence file or troubleshoot report. Do not read the retry folders (legacy `.dev/implement/<slug>/retries/`, managed `<pkg>/artifacts/retries/`) or `.dev/troubleshoot/`. A citation into either makes the verdict `cannot-verify`.
The prior-findings slot above carries earlier blocking finding lines that the orchestrator copies byte for byte from `review-*.md` and `repair-*.md`; they reach you as prompt text, not as an evidence file. Do not read those folders to get them, and never cite the slot or the file it came from.

Use finding ids F1.1, F1.2, ... Return the AC marks and finding lines as your final message (plain text, no file writes).
