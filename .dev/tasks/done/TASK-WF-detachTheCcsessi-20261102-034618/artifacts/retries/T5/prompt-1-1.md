Review one task for spec compliance.

Working directory (git worktree): /home/coder/workspaces/IronClaude/.dev/worktrees/ccsession-proxy-stall. You may Read files and run read-only git/grep commands there. Do not edit anything.
Task brief: ## Task 5: Add the CHANGELOG entry

Depends on: Task 4

In `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`, add a `### ccsession: shim survives its launching terminal (#341)` section with a `#### Fixed` bullet in plain words: the shared gateway shim was started inside the terminal that first launched it, so closing that terminal (Orca kills its descendants) cut every other session's reply and refused new ones until a later launch started a new shim; ccsession now starts it from a subshell and the shim starts its own session, so it keeps running until stopped (`pkill -f local-gateway-alias-proxy.py`).

Acceptance criteria:
- The new section sits directly under `## [Unreleased]`, references #341, and names no file outside the scope.
- Every test file that reads the edited files (found with `grep -rlE "local-gateway-alias-proxy|ccsession-tag" tests/` and listed in ./artifacts/t5-checks.log) passes, and `make lint` and `make verify-sync` pass, with commands and results in ./artifacts/t5-checks.log.
AC ids: T5.AC1 (first bullet), T5.AC2 (second bullet). Task-owned evidence file: .dev/tasks/to-do/TASK-WF-detachTheCcsessi-20261102-034618/artifacts/t5-checks.log (written by this task; read it). Context: a pre-execution review of this plan asked that the entry also say a shim already running keeps the old behaviour; the entry includes that sentence. The sub-heading carries a parenthetical because this CHANGELOG gives every #### heading a unique suffix.
Global constraints: ## Constraints

- Scope is exactly the four files named in the source: `src/superclaude/skills/ccsession-tag/ccsession`, `src/superclaude/skills/ccsession-tag/local-gateway-alias-proxy.py`, `tests/unit/test_ccsession_tiers.py`, `CHANGELOG.md`. Diagnosis and requirements: `.dev/troubleshoot/deployment-ccsession-proxy-4114-stalls-20261102031709/remediation-source.md` and `REPORT.md` in the same directory (issue #341).
- Never signal, restart or reconfigure the running shims on ports 4013 and 4114 (or whatever serves them); never edit anything under `~/.claude`, `~/.ccsession` or the running config; never run `superclaude install`, `superclaude update`, `./update.sh` or `install.sh`.
- Doc restrictions (remediation-source.md AC6; doc-context.md in the troubleshoot directory): the shim's argv keeps the script path (ccsession uses `pgrep -f -- "$CC_SHIM_SCRIPT"` at ccsession:722 and users stop shims with `pkill -f local-gateway-alias-proxy.py`); the shim inherits the launching env; no `setsid` binary (macOS has none) and only Python standard library; bash 3.2 syntax; logging stays opt-in; ccsession never stops a running shim.
- Tests: run only named test files and tests that read the edited files; never the full suite and never `tests/cli/eval/` as a directory. Use `uv run` for Python.
- Every throwaway shim or test process started while working is stopped by its exact pid; no temp files left behind.

Delta diff from the previous reviewed tree (empty on the first review): 
Earlier blocking findings of this start (empty on the first review): 
Saved-probe re-check hit locations (may be empty): 

Do not trust the implementer's report.

First mark each earlier blocking finding resolved, open or regressed from the diff. Then, for each AC, mark it met or unmet. Require citations: every AC you mark, met or unmet, carries a `path:line` or `Ti.ACk@path:line` citation, and an unmet mark lists the finding ids behind it. Do not return a verdict; the orchestrator computes it.

For every finding answer four questions, each yes or no:
1. ac-outcome-missing: is output an AC requires absent, or does it contradict the AC text, or does an evidence claim you could not verify have no evidence row?
2. false-claim: is a claim in delivered text or code false against live source, or does a recipe or instruction followed as written not do what the text says?
3. harmful-effect: does code or a recipe this task added or changed write, append, chmod or delete tracked or production data, mutate state outside the task's declared outputs, or expose a secret?
4. quoted-constraint-breach: does the diff violate a quoted plan constraint, out-of-scope, non-goal or non-negotiable item, or an explicit task instruction?

Anchor rule: cite exactly one anchor per yes. ac-outcome-missing: the quoted AC words. false-claim: the live-source path:line holding the contradicting text. harmful-effect: the diff line that is the write. quoted-constraint-breach: the quoted constraint or instruction text. A yes without a valid anchor does not block.

Write one line per finding:
F<k>.<j> ac=<Ti.ACk|scope> at=<path:line> anchor=<quoted text or path:line> chk=<amiss,false,harm,constraint as y/n> family=<id> fix=<text> [covers=<quoted AC clause or constraint>]: <text>
Do not write sev=, trigger=, first= or origin=; the orchestrator adds them. Write one status line per earlier blocking finding: F<m>.<j> resolved|open|regressed.

Inside /sc:implement this protocol's severity model governs this review and takes precedence over the session's output style and the copy of it injected into every subagent; only blocking findings may fail an attempt.

You are not given an adviser answer, brief, evidence file or troubleshoot report. Do not read the retry folders (legacy `.dev/implement/<slug>/retries/`, managed `<pkg>/artifacts/retries/`) or `.dev/troubleshoot/`. A citation into either makes the verdict `cannot-verify`.
The prior-findings slot above carries earlier blocking finding lines that the orchestrator copies byte for byte from `review-*.md` and `repair-*.md`; they reach you as prompt text, not as an evidence file. Do not read those folders to get them, and never cite the slot or the file it came from.

Use finding ids F1.1, F1.2, ... Return the AC marks and finding lines as your final message (plain text, no file writes).
