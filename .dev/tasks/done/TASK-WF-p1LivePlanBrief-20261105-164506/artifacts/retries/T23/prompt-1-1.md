Review one task for spec compliance.

Task brief: Task T23 (plan file /home/coder/workspaces/worktrees/IronClaude/OrcaCLICommandRefactor-P1/.dev/tasks/to-do/TASK-WF-p1LivePlanBrief-20261105-164506/TASK-WF-p1LivePlanBrief-20261105-164506.md, lines 539-548); AC ids T23.AC1 to T23.AC3 are the bullets under `Acceptance criteria:` in source order. `./artifacts/` means /home/coder/workspaces/worktrees/IronClaude/OrcaCLICommandRefactor-P1/.dev/tasks/to-do/TASK-WF-p1LivePlanBrief-20261105-164506/artifacts/.

## Task 23: Run the AC-1.3 flagless file-creation check

Depends on: Task 1

Gate: read `./artifacts/preflight.md`; if its install line is FAIL, write `./artifacts/ac-1.3.md` with `not run: install precondition failed` and stop. Otherwise create one scratch worktree like the procedure's Worktree step with `<name>` = flagless and files `./artifacts/ac13-...` (receipt `ac13-worktree.json`, `make -C <path> sync-dev` output, `git -C <path> status --short` saved as `ac13-status-before.txt`, and `find <path> -name return-contract.yaml -not -path '*/.git/*' | sort` saved as `ac13-find-before.txt`: the branch tracks many such files, so this is the baseline). In it run these two print-mode sessions, each under `timeout 1200`, with the output saved to `./artifacts/ac13-run-1.txt` and `./artifacts/ac13-run-2.txt`, and `git -C <path> status --short` saved after each as `ac13-status-after-1.txt` and `ac13-status-after-2.txt`: `claude -p "/sc:analyze src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py --depth quick" --max-budget-usd 2 --permission-mode acceptEdits` and `claude -p "/sc:explain src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py --level basic" --max-budget-usd 2 --permission-mode acceptEdits`, each started with the worktree as its current directory (`cd <path>` inside the same Bash command). Then `find <path> -name return-contract.yaml -not -path '*/.git/*' | sort` is saved to `./artifacts/ac13-find.txt`, and `diff ./artifacts/ac13-find-before.txt ./artifacts/ac13-find.txt` to `./artifacts/ac13-find-diff.txt`; a contract file counts as created only when it appears in the diff. Remove the worktree as in the procedure's Remove step (`ac13-remove.json`, `ac13-worktree-list-after.json`). If a `claude -p` run fails to start or is refused by the budget, record that faithfully and do not retry. Write `./artifacts/ac-1.3.md`: the file-creation result (PASS only when both runs completed and `ac13-find-diff.txt` is empty; FAIL when a contract file appears in it; `not verifiable` with the reason when a run did not complete), the two runs' tail output, and the open owner item for the manual part: "run `/sc:analyze <path>` and `/sc:explain <path>` in a plain interactive Claude Code session and in the coordinator session with `WORKER-CONTRACT.md` loaded, and confirm that today's prompts and defaults appear and that no brief-guard refusal occurs". The file ends with the line `Recording status: complete (verdict recorded, not a task failure)`.

Acceptance criteria:
- [T23.AC1] `./artifacts/ac-1.3.md` exists with the file-creation verdict, the evidence files `ac13-run-1.txt`, `ac13-run-2.txt`, `ac13-find-before.txt`, `ac13-find.txt`, `ac13-find-diff.txt`, the status-before and status-after files, the manual owner item quoted above, and the recording-status line.
- [T23.AC2] Either `./artifacts/ac13-worktree-list-after.json` does not list `p1-live-flagless`, or `ac-1.3.md` records why the worktree remains.
- [T23.AC3] The feature worktree's HEAD is unchanged: `git rev-parse HEAD` printed into `./artifacts/ac13-head-after.txt` shows the sha recorded in `./artifacts/branch-tip.txt`.
Global constraints: (plan `## Constraints`, plan lines 17-54, verbatim)
## Constraints

- Spec: `.dev/orca-command-refactor/specs/orca-worker-contract-spec.md` is called "the spec"; "spec 7.2" is its section 7.2 (live worker check, lines 281-304), "spec 7.3" its section 7.3 (per-phase checks), "WC-n" a requirement of its section 2.2. The P1 static plan passed and is archived at `.dev/tasks/done/TASK-WF-writeTheP1Static-20261105-033458/`; its report `artifacts/p1-static-report.md` is cited, not copied. Its edits are committed as `7127c2478756c9444afc600af3e3066b3f7f24db` on branch `ironbelly/OrcaCLICommandRefactor-P1`. The branch tip has moved since: a merge of `origin/master` (`185f8349a57fd6cf1ba5b2e42a90925f0b6f50ae`, pushed once to the fork for safekeeping) and a small `WORKER-CONTRACT.md` brief-flag table edit (`f0e307eb8596f1362bd7b372c55877fc98b1ea1b`, local). So this plan never pins the tip: Task 1 records `git rev-parse HEAD` in `./artifacts/branch-tip.txt`, requires `7127c2478756c9444afc600af3e3066b3f7f24db` to be an ancestor of it, and every later check compares against that file. Revision note: this plan was revised three times before its first task started, from the findings of its pre-execution reviews. Revision 1 (tip pin, install comparison, child worktree setup for AC-1.8, step 5 for guard refusals, Orca version and help coverage) is listed in `.dev/reflect/pre-TASK-WF-p1LivePlanBrief-20261105-164506-20261105165021/post-fix-rechecks.md`. Revision 2 (install comparison limited to what the installer copies, clean-tree check scoped to `src plugins tests`, Task 23 baseline, watcher listing, report-path comparison, Task 1 retry rule, AC-1.8 parent check and owner-instruction markers, wording fixes) is the first list in `.dev/reflect/pre-TASK-WF-p1LivePlanBrief-20261105-164506-20261105172548/post-fix-rechecks.md`. Revision 3 (re-attach the Orca run with `orchestration run-use` after a retry or resume in a new terminal, plus seven wording and listing fixes) is the second list in that same file. The archived P0 live plan `.dev/tasks/done/TASK-WF-writeTheP0LivePl-20261103-215902/` is the model for the procedure and the evidence file names; its P0-only rule (the AC-0.4 report-file and outcome rule) does not apply here, because from P1 on the commands write the WC-4 contract.
- Executor: this plan is run by `/sc:implement` in a top-level session the person opens in Orca (an Orca terminal, so `ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE` is set), in the feature worktree on branch `ironbelly/OrcaCLICommandRefactor-P1`. That session is the coordinator at depth 0. It is never run inside an Orca worker: AC-C6 shows `nestedWorkerMaxDepth` 1 (`.dev/tasks/done/TASK-WF-writeTheP1Static-20261105-033458/artifacts/ac-c6-depth-setting.txt`), and the live tasks start Orca workers.
- Install precondition: the plan never installs. Per spec 7.2 the owner approves, and the coordinator runs `uv run superclaude install --force` from this branch, before this plan runs. Task 1 verifies it. If any installed file differs from the branch, Task 1 records the install line FAIL, and every later live task records `not run: install precondition failed` in its `lc<NN>-result.md` and starts no worktree, Task or worker.
- Scope: the P1 live checks of spec 7.3 (AC-1.2, AC-1.3 file-creation part, AC-1.5, AC-1.6, AC-1.7, AC-1.8), the seven spec 7.2 steps for each, and the P1 phase report (spec line 238: the phase passes only when both plans' checks pass). The static checks (AC-1.1, AC-1.4, AC-C1 to AC-C6) are not re-run. The prompt-and-default-behaviour part of AC-1.3 is manual: it is listed for the owner in the phase report and is not run by this plan.
- No edit to any source, command, skill, agent or test file (nothing under `src/`, `plugins/`, `tests/` or `.claude/` is edited by hand), in the feature worktree or in any disposable worktree. In the feature worktree this plan writes only inside this package (`./artifacts/...`, plus the executor's own `progress.md`). `make sync-dev` inside a disposable worktree is allowed (spec 7.2). Paths written `./artifacts/...` are inside this package.
- No git commit, push, merge, rebase, reset, stash, branch deletion, PR, `gh` write of any kind, no `superclaude install`, no interaction with the SuperClaude-Org upstream repository, and no Orca link flag (`--issue`, `--pr`, `--linear-issue`, `--gitlab-issue`, `--gitlab-mr`), because Orca records this project as the upstream (`github:superclaude-org/superclaude_framework`). The only git writes are the disposable worktrees that `orca worktree create` makes (including the AC-1.8 child created with `--parent-worktree active`) and `orca worktree rm` removes, the staging this plan's last task states, and the one commit a worker makes under AC-1.8 inside its own child worktree. `orca worktree rm` may delete a disposable worktree's local branch by itself; the executor never deletes a branch. Reads of the fork are allowed: `git ls-remote origin` once `git remote get-url origin` prints `https://github.com/IronbellyOrg/IronClaude`, and `gh pr list --repo IronbellyOrg/IronClaude --author @me`.
- UV for every Python command, in the executor and in every subagent or helper it starts: `uv run --no-project python -I <script>` for scripts and `uv run python -c ...` where the project is needed. Never bare `python`, `python3` or `pip` (the P0 run had 24 such calls from review helpers). Every prompt the executor writes for a helper repeats this rule. Test runs set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and pass `-p no:cacheprovider`.
- Staging: never stage anything under `.claude/`. Every `.dev/tasks/` package other than this plan's own stays untouched. This plan's own package is staged by the last task (`git add .dev/tasks`).
- A failed live check is a recorded result: it is not retried, rerun or repaired, and no second worker is started for it. A task is compliant when its check ran as written and every step's result is recorded faithfully with its evidence. A FAIL inside an `lc<NN>-*` step file, an `lc<NN>-result.md` verdict of FAIL, or a P1 verdict of FAIL is a recorded result, not a task failure. Only `lc<NN>-result.md`, `ac-1.3.md` and `p1-phase-report.md` carry check verdicts (the per-condition results in `lc<NN>-step5.md` are condition results, not check verdicts). Each `lc<NN>-result.md` ends with the line `Recording status: complete (verdict recorded, not a task failure)`, and the executor cites that line, not raw step logs, on a task's `evidence=`. A FAIL of AC-1.2 on a P1 command is recorded as a gap in that command; the command is not repaired by this plan.
- Retry, repair and resume never repeat a live check: a fix pass, a retry attempt or a resume of a live task only rebuilds `./artifacts/` from evidence already saved (saved receipts, files under `./artifacts/`, and `worker-read` output, which survives release). It never creates a worktree, Task or worker. Before its Worktree step each live task checks `orca worktree list --json` and `orca orchestration worker-list --run <run_id> --json`; if a `p1-live-<name>` worktree or a worker for this check already exists, it continues from the first procedure step that has no saved evidence, using that worktree and worker. A step whose evidence is gone and cannot be rebuilt is recorded FAIL with that reason. A live task resumed in a new Orca terminal first checks the run's `coordinator_handle` against `$ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE` as Task 1 describes and runs `orca orchestration run-use` when they differ (receipt `./artifacts/run-use-<NN>.json`), because `worker-start` is refused for a run bound to another terminal.
- Orca usage: Task 1 saves the `--help` text of every verb this plan uses. The Orca runtime is 1.4.245-aidev02 (P0 ran on 1.4.237). An Orca usage error at run time is recorded as that step's FAIL with the error and the verb's help text saved under `./artifacts/`; the command is never corrected at run time, because any plan edit after the first task starts halts the run (E-PLAN-CHANGED).
- Every `orca orchestration check --wait` call runs with a Bash tool timeout of at least 300000 ms. A Bash tool timeout is an executor mishap: the same wait is issued again, and it is not a check failure. The executor session makes every Orca call. Workers get the briefs below unchanged; a brief is never edited at run time (the one exception is the owner instruction copied into Task 24's brief, stated there). The briefs' `Worktree:` and `Report directory:` values are deliberate spec 7.2 departures from the WORKER-CONTRACT template; the brief guard checks only `Command:` lines.
- Heartbeat reading (owner decision H1, `.dev/orca-command-refactor/decisions/APPROVED.md`, 2026-11-05): a gap between heartbeats that lies inside a command's own subagent fan-out is accepted. Step 5 condition 4 is exactly limits (a) and (b) of spec 7.2 step 5; the stricter reading is rejected. At least one checked run in this phase must last longer than the heartbeat cadence the worker's preamble states, and the phase report names it.
- Step 5 source: `worker-read --source transcript` returns only the last 40 to 50 messages of a long run (P0 note 1), so step 5 is read from the worker's own Claude session file and cross-checked with `worker-read`. The P0 scripts are `.dev/tasks/done/TASK-WF-writeTheP0LivePl-20261103-215902/artifacts/session-analysis.py` (arguments: the `<dir>` folder, the top-level session file; prints the tool tally, the Skill-call timing, the Orca commands, the heartbeat times and the WC-13 scan) and `session-hbcover.py` (argument: the top-level session file; prints heartbeat gaps with subagent time removed), each run as `uv run --no-project python -I <script> <arguments>`. A missing, ambiguous or unreadable session file makes conditions 1, 2, 4 and 5 `not verifiable`; the check is then not recorded as passed and the phase report lists the gap.
- Disposable worktree facts used by every live check: Orca repo selector `id:de550e99-fa3c-42e2-abfe-1d092771c759`; base ref `refs/heads/ironbelly/OrcaCLICommandRefactor-P1`, used as given, which must resolve to the sha recorded in `./artifacts/branch-tip.txt` (Task 1); agent `claude` with no `--model` and no `--effort`; run id `<run_id>` is the `result.run.id` field of `./artifacts/live-run.json`. Every report directory below is inside the worktree under `.dev/p1-live/`.
- Contract facts the extra assertions rely on (decisions of the static plan, `.dev/tasks/done/TASK-WF-writeTheP1Static-20261105-033458/artifacts/p1-static-report.md`): D-P1-1 graph and impact keep their existing `command` key (`graph`, `impact`) as the worker `command` field; D-P1-2 the report-style commands write `<report-dir>/<name>-report.md` unless `--output` names a file; D-P1-4 brainstorm passes `--unattended` and a nested report directory `<report-dir>/nested/<command>-<n>/` (n starts at 1) to its `/sc:analyze` enrichment and adversarial call, and skips research enrichment and the tasklist and task handoffs; D-P1-7 document needs `--output` for the external, api and guide types; D-P1-8 a failing test suite is a verdict, not a failed run; D-P1-9 adversarial `report_path` is its merged output or null; D-P1-11 init-lite writes the worker contract also on `--dry-run`.
- Live-check procedure, followed by every live task with its own check number `<NN>`, name `<name>`, command file `<command>.md`, brief, report directory `<R>` and extras. Evidence files go under `./artifacts/lc<NN>-...`:
  - Gate: read `./artifacts/preflight.md`. If its install line is FAIL, write `./artifacts/lc<NN>-result.md` with `not run: install precondition failed` and its recording-status line, and stop the task.
  - Worktree: `orca worktree create --repo id:de550e99-fa3c-42e2-abfe-1d092771c759 --name p1-live-<name> --base-branch refs/heads/ironbelly/OrcaCLICommandRefactor-P1 --no-parent --json`, receipt saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-worktree.json`. Its path must not contain `/.dev/worktrees/`, and `git -C <path> rev-parse HEAD` must print the sha recorded in `./artifacts/branch-tip.txt`. Save `git -C <path> branch --show-current` to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-branch.txt`. Then `make -C <path> sync-dev` must exit 0 (output to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-sync-dev.txt`). Then `git -C <path> status --porcelain` is saved as `./artifacts/lc<NN>-status-before.txt`. Any failure here fails step 1: record it, skip to Remove, and do not dispatch.
  - Section check: `grep -c '^## Unattended mode' <path>/.claude/commands/sc/<command>.md ~/.claude/commands/sc/<command>.md`, saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-unattended-check.txt`. For a command that accepts `--unattended` at P1 both copies must print 1; for troubleshoot (Task 21) both must print 0; for help (Task 22) the check is not made because that case is decided by the command name alone. A count other than the one required fails step 1: record it, skip to Remove, and do not dispatch.
  - Step 1: save the task's brief, exactly as written in its fenced block, to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-brief.txt`. Run `orca orchestration task-create --spec "$(cat ./artifacts/lc<NN>-brief.txt)" --task-title "P1 live check <NN>: <name>" --run <run_id> --json`, then `orca orchestration worker-start --task <task_id> --worktree path:<path> --agent claude --run <run_id> --json`, timed with `date +%s.%N` before and after. Save both receipts and the elapsed seconds to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step1.txt`. Pass: worker-start exits 0 with `state: ready`. If worker-start fails, record steps 1-6 as FAIL or not run, release whatever the receipt says it still owns with `orca orchestration worker-release --dispatch <dispatch_id> --json` when it names a dispatch, then go to Step 7 and Remove.
  - Step 2: wait in turns of `orca orchestration check --run <run_id> --wait --types "worker_done,escalation,question" --timeout-ms 240000 --json`, and after every turn run `orca orchestration worker-show --dispatch <dispatch_id> --json`. Append one line per sample (UTC time and the `observation.agentWait` value) to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step2-samples.txt`, so samples are at most 5 minutes apart. Pass: `observation.agentWait` is never non-null. When a step 2 turn returns the `worker_done` message, that message is step 3's message: save and acknowledge it, and do not wait again.
  - Step 3: keep waiting until `worker_done` arrives. When a turn ends with no message, read `orca orchestration worker-read --dispatch <dispatch_id> --source transcript --json`: a growing transcript means keep waiting. A `question` message is answered only with facts about the environment; a request for a decision is not answered, and step 3 fails. Save the `worker_done` message to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step3.json`, then acknowledge its delivery with `orca orchestration check --run <run_id> --ack <delivery_id> --json`. Pass: exactly one `worker_done`; its `--outcome` matches the contract's `worker_status` under WC-5 (`succeeded` and `partial` give `succeeded`; `failed` and `blocked` give `failed`); its report path is the WC-4 contract path `<R>/return-contract.yaml`, compared after both are resolved to an absolute path inside the worktree (`realpath -m`: a doubled slash, a trailing slash on `<R>` or a path relative to the worktree root do not make two equal paths different). The refusal checks of Tasks 18, 20, 21 and 22 replace this pass rule with their own (Task 19 keeps it).
  - Step 3 exits when no `worker_done` comes: (a) stall proof, meaning a transcript whose final agent turn sent no `worker_done`, or `exited` liveness in `orca orchestration worker-list --run <run_id> --json`: record step 3 FAIL with that proof, run `orca orchestration worker-stop --dispatch <dispatch_id> --json` and `orca orchestration task-update --id <task_id> --status failed --result cancelled --run <run_id> --json`, record steps 4-6 from what exists, then go to Step 7 and Remove; (b) a non-null `observation.agentWait` or an unanswered decision question with no stall proof: record step 2 or step 3 FAIL with that sample or message and keep waiting, because Orca forbids stopping a waiting worker without positive proof; if 60 minutes pass after that sample with no `worker_done` and no stall proof, record steps 3-6 FAIL, leave the worker and its worktree running, write their dispatch id and path into `lc<NN>-result.md` as left for the person, record Step 7 and Remove as not run because the worker is not settled, and move to the next task.
  - Step 4: `test -s <path>/<R>/return-contract.yaml`, then `uv run python -c "import sys, yaml; d = yaml.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1])); assert d['worker_contract_version'] == '1'; assert d['worker_status'] in {'succeeded','partial','failed','blocked'}; assert d['command']; assert d['worker_status'] != 'blocked' or d.get('blocked_question')" <path>/<R>/return-contract.yaml`, both saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step4.txt`, then the check's extra assertions. Pass: both commands exit 0 and every extra holds. The refusal checks replace this step with their own conditions.
  - Step 5: locate the worker's session file: `~/.claude/projects/<dir>/<session id>.jsonl`, where `<dir>` is the worktree path with each `/` replaced by `-`; `<dir>` must hold exactly one top-level `.jsonl` file and each subagent's file is under `<dir>/<session id>/subagents/`. Run the two P0 scripts on it after step 3 and before step 7, and save their output to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-session-analysis.txt`. Record the session file's path, byte length and sha256 in `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step5.md`; do not copy the file into the repo. Cross-check: read `orca orchestration worker-read --dispatch <dispatch_id> --source transcript --json` page 1, then once more with the returned `--cursor`, saved as `./artifacts/lc<NN>-transcript-1.json` and `./artifacts/lc<NN>-transcript-2.json`; record `contentComplete`, the time window page 1 covers and whether page 2 is empty; page 1 must show the same final `check` call and the same `worker_done` as the session file. Write `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step5.md` with one verdict and a quoted excerpt for each of five conditions, all read from the session file: no `AskUserQuestion` call in the top-level session or any subagent session (WC-2); the command was run in the worker's top-level session, not inside an Agent-tool call (WC-7); a `check` call appears after the command finished and before `worker_done` (WC-12); heartbeats (WC-10) satisfy limits (a) and (b) of spec 7.2 step 5 against the cadence quoted from the worker's preamble, with the run length and heartbeat count stated; no `worker-start`, `dispatch` or `task-create` call and no `worktree create --agent` or `agent launch` call in any Bash command of the top-level or any subagent session (WC-13), with read-only Orca calls listed. Pass: all five hold. A run shorter than the cadence passes condition 4 vacuously and is recorded as such. For the guard refusal checks (Tasks 20 to 22) the worker refuses before invoking anything, so condition 2 is recorded `not applicable: guard refused before any invocation` and is replaced by `the command was not invoked` (read from the session file); conditions 1, 3, 4 and 5 apply unchanged. For Tasks 18 and 19 the command itself refuses, so all five apply.
  - Step 6: `git -C <path> status --porcelain` saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-status-after.txt`, and `git -C <path> diff --cached --name-only` saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-index-after.txt`. Pass: every path not in `lc<NN>-status-before.txt` is under `<R>` or is a documented artifact of the command, with the file and line that documents it cited in `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step6.md`. Ignored paths are not checked. Any path the worker staged is listed in `lc<NN>-step6.md` as a WC-9 finding for the phase report.
  - Evidence copy: copy `<path>/<R>` into `./artifacts/lc<NN>-report/` (and any other file the task names) before Step 7.
  - Step 7: `orca orchestration worker-release --dispatch <dispatch_id> --json`, then `orca orchestration worker-list --run <run_id> --terminal-state reclaimable --json`, both saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-step7.txt`. Pass: the list returns no rows.
  - Remove: `orca worktree rm --worktree path:<path> --force --json`, saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-remove.json`. Then save `orca worktree list --json` to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-worktree-list-after.json`, the feature worktree's `git rev-parse HEAD` to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-head-after.txt`, and `git branch --list "<the name in lc<NN>-branch.txt>"` to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-branch-after.txt`.
  - Result: `./artifacts/lc<NN>-result.md` lists the worktree setup, the section check, steps 1-7 and Remove as PASS, FAIL or not run, one line each, with the evidence file for each, the extras result, and the check's overall verdict (PASS only when steps 1-7 all pass, with steps 3 and 4 as replaced for the refusal checks, and every extra holds). Its last line is `Recording status: complete (verdict recorded, not a task failure)`.
- Brief layout (spec 2.3). Each live task has one fenced brief in this layout, saved to `./artifacts/lc<NN>-brief.txt` and passed to `task-create --spec` unchanged. The first line is the guard line, so the Task text never starts with `/sc:`.
- Expected outcomes for the final review: a `lc<NN>-result.md` verdict of FAIL or `not verifiable`, or a refusal check whose refusal did not happen, is a recorded result, not a task failure. An AC-1.8 owner instruction that still reads `NOT YET GIVEN` makes Task 24 a recorded `not run`, not a task failure.
- AC-1.8 owner instruction (WC-9, decision D4). `/sc:implement` may not prompt the owner during the run, so the owner's one sentence naming a local commit for the AC-1.8 check is given in the session before the run and copied here as given; the plan edit is allowed because it happens before the first task starts. No separate file is made. The owner's instruction is only the text between the markers `>>>` and `<<<` on the next line; everything else in this bullet is plan text and is never copied into a brief. The sentence was typed by the owner in the orchestrator session at 2026-11-05 18:48 UTC and relayed by that session to this one (decision G1 in `.dev/orca-command-refactor/decisions/APPROVED.md`); it was copied here before the first task started.
  >>>I grant authorization for local commit for check AC-1.8 only.<<<
- Task order: the tasks run one at a time, in order. No two workers run at once, because `check --run` receives every worker's messages and a machine-wide process listing is used by Task 19.

# AC-1.3 flagless file-creation check (spec 7.3 AC-1.3, file-creation part)

Result (file creation): **PASS**. Both print-mode runs completed (exit code 0) and `ac13-find-diff.txt` is empty: neither a plain `/sc:analyze` nor a plain `/sc:explain` created a `return-contract.yaml` in the scratch worktree.

Setup and cleanup: scratch worktree `p1-live-flagless` created by `orca worktree create ... --no-parent` (`ac13-worktree.json`, branch `ac13-branch.txt`, `make sync-dev` output `ac13-sync-dev.txt` rc 0); HEAD equalled `branch-tip.txt` at creation. Removal: `ac13-remove.json` (`removed: true`), `ac13-worktree-list-after.json` does not list `p1-live-flagless`, and the feature worktree's HEAD is unchanged (`ac13-head-after.txt` equals `branch-tip.txt`).

Evidence files:
- Status: `ac13-status-before.txt` (empty), `ac13-status-after-1.txt` (empty), `ac13-status-after-2.txt` (empty): neither run left any file in the worktree.
- Contract-file listings: `ac13-find-before.txt` (325 tracked files, the baseline), `ac13-find.txt` (325 files), `ac13-find-diff.txt` (empty).
- Runs (each `timeout 1200 claude -p "<command>" --max-budget-usd 2 --permission-mode acceptEdits`, started in the worktree): `ac13-run-1.txt` (`/sc:analyze src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py --depth quick`) and `ac13-run-2.txt` (`/sc:explain src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py --level basic`).

Tail output of run 1 (`ac13-run-1.txt`):

```text
**1. Medium: Destination setup errors escape the result contract.** At `src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:55`, creating the destination happens outside error handling. A permission-denied directory or an existing file at that path raises an exception instead of returning the documented `(success, message)` result.

**2. Medium: Forced installation can damage an existing file before reporting failure.** At `src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:74`, copying writes directly to the destination. A failed write, such as running out of disk space, can leave existing instructions truncated; catching the exception does not restore them.

**Recommended action:** Handle destination creation errors and copy through a temporary sibling file before replacing the destination, with regression tests for both failure paths.

Skipped runtime execution and tests because this command requests static analysis. The findings are source-backed, but their failure paths were not reproduced.
claude run 1 rc=0
```

Tail output of run 2 (`ac13-run-2.txt`):

```text
- **Copy them:** The main installation function creates the destination folder, normally `~/.claude/`, then copies each document there (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:31`).
- **Protect existing files:** It skips files already present unless `force=True` allows replacement. Replacement can overwrite personal changes (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:69`).
- **Report the result:** It returns a success value plus a message listing installed, skipped, and failed files. All files being skipped still counts as success (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:79`).
- **Provide inventories:** Two helpers list available documents and installed documents. The installed list includes only filenames in the predefined known-files list (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:129`).

**Recommended action:** None needed for this explanation.
Not checked: a live installation or tests. This explains the source behavior, not a verified installation run.
claude run 2 rc=0
```

Open owner item (the manual part of AC-1.3, not run by this plan): "run `/sc:analyze <path>` and `/sc:explain <path>` in a plain interactive Claude Code session and in the coordinator session with `WORKER-CONTRACT.md` loaded, and confirm that today's prompts and defaults appear and that no brief-guard refusal occurs".

**This file copies SuperClaude’s instruction documents into Claude Code’s configuration folder.** Think of it as a small file installer, not the code that runs the instructions.

- **Find the documents:** It locates the package’s `core` folder and selects its Markdown files (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:107`).
- **Copy them:** The main installation function creates the destination folder, normally `~/.claude/`, then copies each document there (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:31`).
- **Protect existing files:** It skips files already present unless `force=True` allows replacement. Replacement can overwrite personal changes (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:69`).
- **Report the result:** It returns a success value plus a message listing installed, skipped, and failed files. All files being skipped still counts as success (`src/superclaude/cli/install_core.py:79`).

Delta diff from the previous reviewed tree (empty on the first review): (empty)
Earlier blocking findings of this start (empty on the first review): (empty)
Saved-probe re-check hit locations (may be empty): (empty)

Do not trust the implementer's report.

First mark each earlier blocking finding resolved, open or regressed from the diff. Then, for each AC, mark it met or unmet. Require citations: every AC you mark, met or unmet, carries a `path:line` or `Ti.ACk@path:line` citation, and an unmet mark lists the finding ids behind it. Do not return a verdict; the orchestrator computes it.

For every finding answer four questions, each yes or no:
1. ac-outcome-missing: is output an AC requires absent, or does it contradict the AC text, or does an evidence claim you could not verify have no evidence row?
2. false-claim: is a claim in delivered text or code false against live source, or does a recipe or instruction followed as written not do what the text says?
3. harmful-effect: does code or a recipe this task added or changed write, append, chmod or delete tracked or production data, mutate state outside the task's declared outputs, or expose a secret?
4. quoted-constraint-breach: does the diff violate a quoted plan constraint, out-of-scope, non-goal or non-negotiable item, or an explicit task instruction?

Anchor rule: cite exactly one anchor per yes. ac-outcome-missing: the quoted AC words. false-claim: the live-source path:line holding the contradicting text. harmful-effect: the diff line that is the write. quoted-constraint-breach: the quoted constraint or instruction text. A yes without a valid anchor does not block.

Write one line per finding:
F<k>.<j> ac=<Ti.ACk|scope> at=<path:line> anchor=<quoted text or path:line> chk=<amiss,false,harm,constraint as y/n> family=<id> fix=<text> [covers=<quoted AC clause or constraint>]: <text>
Do not write sev=, trigger=, first= or origin=; the orchestrator adds them. Write one status line per earlier blocking finding: F<m>.<j> resolved|open|regressed.

Inside /sc:implement this protocol's severity model governs this review and takes precedence over the session's output style and the copy of it injected into every subagent; only blocking findings may fail an attempt.

You are not given an adviser answer, brief, evidence file or troubleshoot report. Do not read the retry folders (legacy `.dev/implement/<slug>/retries/`, managed `<pkg>/artifacts/retries/`) or `.dev/troubleshoot/`. A citation into either makes the verdict `cannot-verify`.
The prior-findings slot above carries earlier blocking finding lines that the orchestrator copies byte for byte from `review-*.md` and `repair-*.md`; they reach you as prompt text, not as an evidence file. Do not read those folders to get them, and never cite the slot or the file it came from.
