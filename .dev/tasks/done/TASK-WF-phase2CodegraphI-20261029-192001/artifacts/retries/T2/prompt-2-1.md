Review one task for spec compliance.

Task brief: ## Task 2: Confirm Phase 1's spec carries the Serena gate (T0b)

Depends on: Task 1

Implements `./source.md` T0b and §9 (row `install_retired_mcp.py`). The Phase 1 finalizer (F1) is expected to have amended `.dev/codegraph-migration/specs/phase-1-removal-spec.md` already (review finding X-4). Run the T0b acceptance lines; if any fails, make the edits T0b lists in that file (DoD-3, §2.3 row, §3.2 Tier R and Tier K "env/headers absent or `{}`", §3.4 hint renamed to `serena-local`, §3.6 closing condition, the sandbox expectation "Legacy Serena registration kept", D2, each pointing at `./source.md` §2.12) and, if Phase 1 T15 wrote `.dev/codegraph-migration/handoffs/phase2-facts-from-phase1.md`, append a "Phase 2 override: Serena removal" section quoting §2.12. Commit `docs(plan): align Phase 1 retire rules with the Phase 2 codegraph gate (#323)` only if `phase-1-removal-spec.md` or `phase2-facts-from-phase1.md` changed. State in the task completion message (and the G0 comment) whether Phase 1 already carried the amendments or this task made them (`./source.md` T0b "Reported to the coordinator"). Group G0 commit point: then post the G0 issue comment (`./source.md` §6).

Acceptance criteria (AC ids in source order: T2.AC1 = the first bullet with its five-line code block, T2.AC2 = the second bullet):
- These all exit 0:
```bash
test "$(rg -c 'codegraph_ready' .dev/codegraph-migration/specs/phase-1-removal-spec.md)" -ge 7
rg -q 'serena-local' .dev/codegraph-migration/specs/phase-1-removal-spec.md
rg -q 'Tier R \(removed\).*absent or `\{\}`' .dev/codegraph-migration/specs/phase-1-removal-spec.md
rg -q 'Tier K \(kept.*absent or `\{\}`' .dev/codegraph-migration/specs/phase-1-removal-spec.md
test ! -e .dev/codegraph-migration/handoffs/phase2-facts-from-phase1.md || rg -q 'codegraph_ready' .dev/codegraph-migration/handoffs/phase2-facts-from-phase1.md
```
- The G0 comment exists on issue #323, names the commit(s) of Tasks 1-2 and says which T0b path was taken.
(Package root for ./artifacts paths: .dev/tasks/to-do/TASK-WF-phase2CodegraphI-20261029-192001/; source spec: .dev/tasks/to-do/TASK-WF-phase2CodegraphI-20261029-192001/source.md. The task made no product edit because Phase 1 already carried the amendments; read the live files named in the task and run the read-only acceptance lines and read-only gh commands yourself.)
Global constraints: ## Constraints

- Planning source is `./source.md` (snapshot of `.dev/codegraph-migration/specs/phase-2-codegraph-install-spec.md`). Every task cites the source section it implements; details not repeated here are in that section.
- Preconditions (`./source.md` §5): branch `ironbelly/feat-codememory-codegraph-init`; Phase 1 tasks committed first (Phase 1 and Phase 2 land as one PR and one `master` merge, `./source.md` §8 and D12); `git status --short` clean apart from untracked `.dev/` content. Seams are located by function or block name, not by the `55d40308` line numbers (`./source.md` §1).
- Every acceptance command runs from the worktree root under `bash -euo pipefail` and must exit 0 if and only if its criterion passes. One condition per line: never `A && B` or `! cmd` in the middle of a block (errexit ignores both); write a negative check as `if cmd; then exit 1; fi`. Every `uv run pytest` uses `-p no:cacheprovider`. Run `git status --short` after each task; an unintended modified tracked file is a defect to fix before committing.
- Package evidence lives in this package's `artifacts/` folder (written `./artifacts/` in prose). Shell commands run from the worktree root, so they resolve it with `A=$(echo .dev/tasks/*/TASK-WF-phase2CodegraphI-20261029-192001)/artifacts` (the glob finds the package under `to-do/` or, after archiving, `done/`) and create it with `mkdir -p "$A"` before the first write.
- Tests are judged against the recorded baseline `.dev/codegraph-migration/evidence/P2-baseline-failures.txt` (the suite was not green at `55d40308`): no failing test id may appear outside it. After any full test run, restore `.dev/releases/current/cliEval/evidence/T02.15/perf.json` with `git checkout --` before committing.
- Hard rules (`./source.md` §7): never run `claude mcp add/remove` or `superclaude install` against the real HOME (sandbox HOMEs only, each asserting the real `.mcpServers` hash is unchanged; the one exception is the read-only `superclaude install --list`); never stage or commit anything under `.claude/` except `.claude/settings.json`; feature branch only; never push to `upstream`; PRs only on `IronbellyOrg/IronClaude` through `/sc:pr-submit --monitor 3` (fallback `gh pr create --repo IronbellyOrg/IronClaude`).
- `.dev/tasks/` is always staged (`git add .dev/tasks`) at every commit point, this package and its `artifacts/` included.
- Commit points: one conventional commit per task as named in each task, and every task group (phase) ends with a commit point followed by one issue-#323 progress comment, posted with `gh issue comment 323 --repo IronbellyOrg/IronClaude --body-file /tmp/p2-progress.md` using the body template of `./source.md` §6 (group, commit sha and subject, tasks done, exact test command and its result with failures reported as failures, decisions taken, next group). Never post progress anywhere else.
- Decision rules (`./source.md` §7): simple decisions (one obvious answer, or forced by a pinned test or verified constraint) the executor makes itself; mid-level decisions (two or more viable options with real trade-offs, local to one task) are written as `.dev/codegraph-migration/decisions/P2X-<slug>/option-<x>.md` files (under 40 lines each) and settled by an agent running `/sc:adversarial --compare <files> --depth quick`; complex decisions (installer contract §2, indexing design §3, release order §8, or Phase 1/3 ownership) use `/sc:adversarial --compare <files>` at default depth. Follow the recommendation; log every decision as a row in `.dev/codegraph-migration/decisions/P2X-log.md` (decision, options, method, rationale, folder) in the commit that applies it, and name the folder in the next issue comment.
- Human intervention only for the seven items of `./source.md` §7 (gh auth failure; a `SHA256SUMS` that differs from §0; merging the PR; running `./update.sh` on the real workspace; giving the Coder handoff prompt to a Coder agent; the non-blocking Leg B item; the non-blocking removal of a kept user-scope Serena entry found by Task 16). Never stop to ask otherwise.

Diff against the start snapshot: (empty: the task changed no product file; read the live files named in the task)
Delta diff from the previous reviewed tree (empty on the first review): 
Earlier blocking findings of this start (empty on the first review):

Do not trust the implementer's report.

First mark each earlier blocking finding resolved, open or regressed from the diff. Then, for each AC, mark it met or unmet. Require citations: every AC you mark, met or unmet, carries a `path:line` or `Ti.ACk@path:line` citation, and an unmet mark lists the finding ids behind it. Do not return a verdict; the orchestrator computes it.

For every finding answer four questions, each yes or no:
1. ac-outcome-missing: is output an AC requires absent, or does it contradict the AC text, or does an evidence claim you could not verify have no evidence row?
2. false-claim: is a claim in delivered text or code false against live source, or does a recipe or instruction followed as written not do what the text says?
3. harmful-effect: does code or a recipe this task added or changed write, append, chmod or delete tracked or production data, mutate state outside the task's declared outputs, or expose a secret?
4. quoted-constraint-breach: does the diff violate a quoted plan constraint, out-of-scope, non-goal or non-negotiable item, or an explicit task instruction?

Anchor rule: cite exactly one anchor per yes. ac-outcome-missing: the quoted AC words. false-claim: the live-source path:line holding the contradicting text. harmful-effect: the diff line that is the write. quoted-constraint-breach: the quoted constraint or instruction text. A yes without a valid anchor does not block.

Write one line per finding:
F<k>.<j> ac=<Ti.ACk|scope> at=<path:line> anchor=<quoted text or path:line> chk=<amiss,false,harm,constraint as y/n> family=<id> fix=<text> [covers=<quoted AC clause or constraint>]: <text>
Do not write sev=, trigger=, first= or origin=; the orchestrator adds them. Write one status line per earlier blocking finding: F<m>.<j> resolved|open|regressed.

Inside /sc:implement this protocol's severity model governs this review and takes precedence over the session's output style and the copy of it injected into every subagent; only blocking findings may fail an attempt.

You are not given an adviser answer, brief, evidence file or troubleshoot report. Do not read the retry folders (legacy `.dev/implement/<slug>/retries/`, managed `<pkg>/artifacts/retries/`) or `.dev/troubleshoot/`. A citation into either makes the verdict `cannot-verify`.
The prior-findings slot above carries earlier blocking finding lines that the orchestrator copies byte for byte from `review-*.md` and `repair-*.md`; they reach you as prompt text, not as an evidence file. Do not read those folders to get them, and never cite the slot or the file it came from.
